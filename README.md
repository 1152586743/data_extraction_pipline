This repository contains two independent pipelines for digital pathology data processing:

- [**pipline_data_patch_level/**](./pipline_data_patch_level) â€” Patch-level workflow using QuPath + CLAM for whole-slide patch extraction, labeling, and classification.  
- [**pipline_data_cell_level/**](./pipline_data_cell_level) â€” Cell-level workflow using QuPath for cell detection, feature export, and UMAP visualization.

Each folder includes its own detailed `README.md` with full instructions and scripts.
