00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.970
Hi I'm Dr. Jerad Gardner and today we are
going to talk about the basic patterns of

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:07.970
melanoma.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.709
melanoma is a huge topic and there's so much
that entire text books have been written about

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:19.600
this so much to discuss but I want to go over
some of the basic features that we see histologically

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.620
that make us think about melanoma when we're
evaluating melanocytic lesions I have a video

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:30.601
about the basics of benign melanocytic nevi
and if you haven't watched that yet I'll put

00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:34.180
a link in the top right corner of this video
and also in the video description down below

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.769
that might be useful because we're going to
talk about some of the ways that melanoma

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:46.840
violates the rules that we usually see in
benign nevi so a few of the things that we

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.530
look at this is a little bit of an unusual
melanoma to start with because of all the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.300
keratin up top there's tons of dead keratin
and scale what we call scale parakeratosis

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.300
with a lot of pigment in it up over top of
the lesion there's also some crust in there

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.180
too some serum so this was an inflamed and
irritated melanoma but all of that crust actually

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.049
made it look very much like an inflamed seborrhoeic
keratosis to the dermatologist I remember

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.140
distinctly actually when I called to report
the diagnosis in this case and it was a long

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.829
time ago but I remember they were really surprised
because it really looked so much like a seborrhoeic

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:29.689
keratosis and this is a good reminder of the
importance of what we do as pathologists we

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.570
have an important job still because sometimes
even very good dermatologists or very good

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.219
clinicians of other sorts have difficulty
distinguishing between different entities

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:45.229
clinically and we can often add value and
help when we look at lesions microscopically

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.210
and again this video is for educational purposes
to help teach you like all of my videos are

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.690
this is not a consultation this doesn't replace
the need to get a consultation if you're not

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.799
sure if it's a melanoma or not get expert
help a lot rides on a diagnosis of melanoma

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.760
versus nevus and this is something that's
very important and for patient care and legally

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.569
of course so that's the main point this is
true again for all of my videos these are

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.440
for educational purposes and to help you learn
about how we diagnose these things but of

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.000
course you have to use your own medical judgment
and get help when you need it so one of the

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.460
first features I think that's useful when
you look at melanomas start like just like

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.190
for nevi start at low power ok look at the
lesion at 2x or 4x whatever the lowest power

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.450
objective is on your scope symmetry is a useful
thing does the lesion if you draw a line down

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:47.459
the middle of it from top to bottom if I go
like this and make a line

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.489
is the left side a mirror image of the right
side well you might look at this and say yeah

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.230
more or less it kind of looks the same on
both sides but this is why it's important

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.741
to not just look at the middle of the lesion
in fact if I put down a slide and I see some

00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:04.750
obvious abnormality in the middle I oftentimes
will go make myself look out at the edges

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.170
first because I know that I'll get so fixated
on this obviously abnormal finding that sometimes

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.630
it's easy to forget looking at the periphery
of the biopsy particularly on a broad shave

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.670
biopsy and you know in the case where you
have a basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.550
say we don't have that here but if you have
one of those sometimes if you don't look at

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.870
the edge you might miss there may be a little
melanoma out to the side I've seen that happen

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.250
a few times so I try to always make myself
look at the periphery the normal looking stuff

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.519
away from the main tumor in the middle and
then when I've determined that that's all

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.690
clear come back to the tumor that way I don't
get too fixated on the tumor and forget to

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.329
check those edges okay so just a little a
general tip for derm path but look as we go

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.329
out here to the side this may look like normal
skin at first glance compared to what we were

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:57.239
just looking at but look closer there are
actually melanocytes in here increased melanocytes

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:04.120
and you can see they're grayish brown they
have this kind of dirty grayish cytoplasm

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.360
which we often see in melanomas but sometimes
in nevi there's a mitosis in here there's

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.090
really marked nuclear atypia a lot of the
features we're going to talk about throughout

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.620
this video but this is melanoma out here so
when you compare or contrast that rather this

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.750
doesn't look like much maybe but here we have
one side of lesion that looks very different

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.540
from the other side of the lesion so asymmetrical
lesions doesn't mean that they are always

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.180
melanoma but it's a warning sign and you should
go look closer and think about the possibility

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.430
of melanoma and that's going to be true for
all of the points that we discuss in this

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:48.810
video I'm going to talk to you about asymmetry
about Pagetoid spread confluent growth abnormal

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.180
maturation or loss of maturation in the dermis
mitotic activity in the dermis and nuclear

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.070
atypia in the melanocytes those are kind of
the main features all of those together that

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:06.080
I think of for melanoma the problem is that
none of those features is perfect okay I can

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.360
point to a benign nevus that has one of the
I mean I've seen all of those different features

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.770
usually by themselves in nevi before I've
seen nevi that are asymmetric I've seen nevi

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.639
that have mitosis or that have atypia or that
have apparently abnormal maturation and the

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.090
dermis okay I've even seen pagetoid spread
in nevi so that's the problem and that's what

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.419
makes derm path and particularly melanocytic
derm path hard is that there are not easy

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:35.230
rules or firm hard and fast rules that you
can use all of the rules by putting air quotes

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.800
you can't see it but I'm putting air quotes
around the word rules all of the rules can

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.919
be broken okay and you can also have melanomas
that don't have some of the features that

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.819
we're going to discuss today usually they'll
have at least one or multiple of those features

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:54.569
but not always they're not some melanomas
look symmetric symmetrical and are not asymmetric

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:58.360
okay so I think it's important to just remember
that these are general guidelines and when

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.849
you see these things stop and think about
melanoma but you have to put the entire microscopic

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:06.330
picture together all the different data points
and you have to put together the clinical

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.690
scenario and make sure it makes sense is it
a one-year-old baby then it's probably not

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.669
a melanoma it's not that little babies can't
get melanomas they are extremely rare but

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:21.770
it has been reported okay is it a ninety year
old person and you think that this is a really

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.919
large nevus on their scalp and they're really
sun damaged well could it be yep possibly

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:30.230
but there's a really good chance that you're
dealing with the melanoma instead so you have

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.840
to use the clinical scenario and make sure
that the diagnosis that you want to make makes

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.910
sense and that's true I think in all of pathology
particularly in derm path particularly in

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:45.360
melanocytic derm path okay so that with all
those caveats let's go back to the features

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.080
so we talked about asymmetry where one side
of the lesion looks very different from the

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.819
other side of the lesion and I just recently
learned I'm reading a textbook right now about

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:57.879
nevi and melanoma and it's written by Guido
Massi and Philip Leboit and it's a wonderful

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:02.180
book I'm not paid to say this I just think
it's really great and one thing that they

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.669
pointed out is that asymmetry of pigment when
you have a lot of pigment on one half of the

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:10.680
lesion and not as much pigment on the other
half of lesion that can also be a sign to

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.129
make you wonder about the possibility of melanoma
so that's something I had not learned before

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:20.181
and I'm still learning new things about melanocytic
lesions all the time all right so enough you're

00:07:20.181 --> 00:07:23.910
probably saying enough of this low power stuff
show me high power well you don't really need

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:28.290
high power in this case to see that there
is unbelievable amount of Pagetoid spread

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:34.919
okay Pagetoid spread refers to the scattering
of melanocytes which normally live in in normal

00:07:34.919 --> 00:07:40.960
skin the melanocytes normally live along the
basal layer of the epidermis oh you I'm sorry

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.620
you can't see the basal layer on the video
there they normally live down here along the

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.970
basal layer in normal skin and if you need
a refresher on normal skin histology I've

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:54.330
got a video on that too and you can check
that out I'll put a link in the upper right-hand

00:07:54.330 --> 00:08:02.009
corner of this video as well okay and so that's
where melanocytes normally live and nevi the

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:06.050
melanocytes begin to come together and make
nests those nests are also usually located

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:11.449
down at the basal layer at the bottom of the
epidermis when we start seeing a significant

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:16.240
number of melanocytes scattering or spreading
up into the upper reaches of the epidermis

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:22.270
into the spinous layer or even up to the granular
layer or beyond we have to think about melanoma

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:26.729
okay and we say Pagetoid because this is a
similar pattern that we see in Paget's disease

00:08:26.729 --> 00:08:32.870
of the nipple or an extra mammary Paget’s
disease where we have malignant glandular

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:37.720
type epithelial cells that are scattering
and spreading upwards into the epidermis also

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:42.230
remember that other tumors can have Pagetoid
spread squamous cell carcinoma in situ is

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:47.040
actually the most common tumor that I see
in my practice with Pagetoid spread I see

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:52.150
Pagetoid spread in squamous cell carcinoma
almost everyday and of course I see melanomas

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:57.720
almost every day as well but it's certainly
a lot more frequent I think to see Squams

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.720
and just keep that in mind that not everything
with Pagetoid spread is necessarily melanoma

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.970
okay it's not necessarily even melanocytic
there are other things that have Pagetoid

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:11.810
spread but when we see lots of when we see
a melanocytic lesion with lots of scattering

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.960
of the melanocytes upwards that's Pagetoid
spread that's a very strong warning sign for

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:21.060
melanoma now irritated Nevi sometimes can
get occasional Pagetoid cells particularly

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.700
in the middle of the lesion but again like
this it would be it would be I don't think

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:30.250
I've ever seen a nevus that has this much
Pagetoid spread personally and also the other

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:34.410
thing that can be helpful is as you look out
the side of the lesion here's the other side

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:40.500
and then show you before but if you see Pagetoid
spread and scattering of melanocytes and here

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.381
we have some right here some Pagetoid spread
right in here and we're way out at the edge

00:09:44.381 --> 00:09:48.660
the periphery of the lesion so that's also
a strong warning sign okay so if you think

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.670
it looks perfect for a Nevus and there may
be one or two pagetoid cells in the middle

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:58.420
well that might be just an irritated Nevus
or acral nevi on acral skin sometimes that

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:04.750
Pagetoid spread and so do Spitz nevi sometimes
and Reed nevi so again there are lots of exceptions

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:08.750
but when you see tons of Pagetoid spread when
you see Pagetoid spread at the periphery of

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:13.370
the lesion those are worrying signs for melanoma
okay and again that's why I selected this

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:18.180
case because it's unbelievable amount of Pagetoid
spread and you know one thing I'll point out

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:23.740
is unlike squamous cell carcinoma in situ
even when you have a florid amount of atypical

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:28.920
melanocytes and pagetoid spread they don't
usually fully replace the epidermis I've seen

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.350
occasional times where they can almost replace
it or kind of consume it with large nests

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:38.760
and but you usually will have them intervened
with there see there's pink keratinocytes

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:45.230
in between all of these nests and single Pagetoid
cells okay and so that's a useful thing that

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:48.990
in squamous situ you will usually you may
have areas that look kind of like this but

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:53.820
you'll also have other areas usually a full
thickness epidermal atypia and that's a useful

00:10:53.820 --> 00:11:00.750
clue on H&amp;E to tell apart a squamous situ
from melanoma okay and here again it's just

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.830
it's an amazing amount of pagetoid spread
that the pagetoid melanocytes are breaking

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:11.050
through the epidermis here kind of even coming
out into the corneal layer we don't always

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:15.600
see that but sometimes we do okay and what
we have this let's look closer and see the

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:22.230
cytologic features so obviously cytologic
atypia is something that we often see in melanomas

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:27.800
okay and atypia is can be a little bit hard
to evaluate and as Bruce Smoller one of my

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:33.650
mentors said atypia is in the eye of the beholder
and while some people might disagree with

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:38.570
that I think in my experience that's actually
proven to be true sometimes things might seem

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:43.050
atypical to me and one of my colleagues might
not think it looks cytologically atypical

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:47.930
and also it depends on the clinical context
again I've seen congenital nevi in young kids

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:53.560
that have big cells that if you would put
that cell in a junctional melanocytic lesion

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:58.990
in the scalp of an 80 year old sun-damaged
person I would say that's super atypical severe

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.650
atypia but if you put it in a congenital nevus
that's obviously benign in a baby I'd say

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:09.150
oh that's just some random nuclear enlargement
so you do have to keep in mind that atypia

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:14.370
can be somewhat subjective and the context
matters but I think here even you know medical

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:19.020
students and even junior trainees would agree
these cells are really atypical they're huge

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:23.380
way bigger than normal melanocytes they're
even bigger than the adjacent keratinocytes

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:29.170
they have very large nucleoli in the center
and people often talk about melanoma as having

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:36.520
cherry-red nucleoli but actually all nucleoli
tend to have a reddish a reddish color to

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.990
them and that's because there are proteins
ribosomal proteins going in and fusing with

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:45.350
ribosomal RNA within the nucleus at least
that's what I've been told and that explains

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:49.880
why there's more of that kind of reddish pink
color to the nucleoli but melanoma do often

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:54.131
have big nucleoli and they're often kind of
that reddish color and we can also see in

00:12:54.131 --> 00:12:58.120
this example here pleomorphism and we can
see that some of the cells are very large

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:03.010
and whereas other tumor cells are smaller
so we have a variation of size and shape of

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:07.590
multiple times the largest tumor cell is multiple
times bigger than the smallest tumor cell

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:12.450
we also the chromatin pattern of melanoma
it can vary but a lot of times its kind of

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:17.740
coarse or chunky chromatin where you'll have
areas that are pale and then blobs of darker

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:23.020
chromatin sometimes it can be diffusely hyperchromatic
sometimes it can be very pale and vesicular

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:30.370
but a lot of times its kind of a coarse chromatin
pattern okay so these are very atypical cells

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:36.270
and they are melanocytes and you can see here
that they are melanocytes oftentimes in normal

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:41.980
skin have a pink or gray cytoplasm with very
little if any visible melanin pigment and

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:47.180
again in my normal skin histology video I
talked about that to some extent melanocytic

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:51.790
lesions oftentimes will have melanin pigment
with them but the melanin pigment is still

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:57.590
usually prominent in the keratinocytes not
in the melanocytes normally make melanin pigment

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:03.290
and transfer it to adjacent keratinocytes
in the basal layer that's the normal physiology

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:09.850
of melanocytes in the skin okay but sometimes
melanocytes can make pigment and the pigment

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:16.100
will build up in the cytoplasm of the of the
melanocytes you both in nevi and in melanoma

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:22.550
okay so that's important because being able
to tell pigment that is a melanocytic cell

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:27.030
versus some other cells really important because
sometimes that will impact your ability to

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:32.310
decide if the tumors actually invasive or
something else so when you have a really dense

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:37.680
chunks of pigment a lot of times that will
indicate a cell like here in the dermis look

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:42.670
these dense clumps of melanin pigment these
are actually melanophages this is melanin

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:48.030
that's fallen out of the epidermis into the
dermis and is eaten up by macrophages so usually

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:52.290
really darkly pigmented cells tend to not
be melanocytes but there are some exceptions

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:56.350
and here's one example where you're starting
to see some of the melanocytes picking up

00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:00.940
a fair amount or having a fair amount of melanin
building up in their cytoplasm usually I would

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:05.840
say when you see pigment in melanoma cells
though it looks like this this kind of dusty

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:11.510
or dirty brownish gray cytoplasm so we have
this kind of grayish cytoplasm that has little

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:17.060
specks little stipples of melanin pigment
in the cytoplasm okay so I think that's pretty

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:24.120
helpful that grayish cytoplasm with little
fine granules of melanin you can see that

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:30.670
in some examples of melanoma okay but again
all of this pigment down here this belongs

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:35.690
these are melanophages not invasion so even
though this melanoma is really exuberant there's

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:41.420
tons of cells almost all of it is in the epidermis
see you can look down to the dermis and we

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:45.620
see inflammation in the dermis a host response
that the inflammation that's responding to

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:50.680
this overlying tumor but there's actually
no invasion of melanoma past the basement

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:58.660
membrane let's look here again is another
example of cytologic atypia if I can get it

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:07.970
into focus here huge atypical melanocytes
right along here okay and there's a mitoses

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:11.760
now we'll talk about mitoses here in a minute
but you have to be careful about mitoses in

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.560
the epidermal portion of a melanocytic lesion
okay the reason it's not that they're not

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:22.980
important there have been some recent studies
that have shown that actually junctional mitoses

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:28.810
are more frequently seen in melanoma than
in nevi but it's not totally specific and

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:32.850
part of the problem is that how do I know
that that mitosis is in a melanocyte rather

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:37.510
than a background keratinocyte because basal
keratinocytes are supposed to divide and to

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:44.140
divide a cell needs to have mitosis so just
interpret mitoses in the epidermis with caution

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.100
certainly if you start seeing a lot of them
think about melanoma but don't let that be

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:52.980
your sole feature that mean these very well
may be in melanocytes but it's oftentimes

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:57.640
difficult to tell for sure okay so if that's
the only thing we're going you is that you've

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:02.100
seen in mitosis in the epidermis and otherwise
the lesion looks like a nevus stop and make

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:07.910
sure that that's really in a melanocytes and
look at the other features but that by itself

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:12.089
would not worry me too much in this case though
obviously we have atypia we have Pagetoid

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:18.310
spread asymmetry all of these other bad things
and this is clearly a melanoma but when we're

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:23.140
when we're counting mitosis for prognostic
staging of melanomas we do not count them

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:28.940
all the mitosis that are in the in situ component
in the epidermis we only count the mitosis

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:34.790
that are in dermal invasive melanocytes okay
and we'll talk more about that in a minute

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:41.480
so anyway this is an example of a melanoma
that shows marked cytologic atypia a unbelievable

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:47.010
amount of Pagetoid spread and asymmetry all
of which are features of melanoma I would

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:53.130
classified probably as a superficial spreading
melanoma so there historically are four major

00:17:53.130 --> 00:18:00.740
subtypes of melanoma superficial spreading,
acral lentiginous, lentigo maligna, and nodular

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:05.940
and now in modern times we've accepted a variety
of additional patterns or subtypes that we

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:11.240
see but those are the four classic patterns
those are useful because they all show different

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.490
features they have different clinical features
they often have different molecular features

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:21.510
underneath them but the individual subtype
doesn't really impact the prognosis of the

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:26.420
melanoma the most important prognostic factor
for melanoma is if it's invasive and how deep

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:32.430
the invasion goes the breslow depth or breslow
thickness of the tumor okay which is the measurement

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:37.240
in invasive melanomas that's the most important
prognostic factor for melanoma regardless

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:42.620
of what type of melanoma it is but most of
the subtyping is done kind of for historical

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:47.870
reasons I know plenty of dermatopathologists
that do not usually provide a subtype I still

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:52.180
tend to because the dermatologists and surgeons
that I work with are still interested to know

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:57.420
if it's a superficial spreading or lentigo
maligna or acral lentiginous or whatever so

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:02.480
I usually will put those when I can when I'm
not sure of what subtype that I just say unclassified

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:08.070
and that's just my personal approach to how
I handle melanoma diagnosis in my practice

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:15.790
this is actually an acral lentiginous melanoma
and it is on acral skin as you can see and

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:22.010
this melanoma on acral skin shows again a
dramatic amount of pagetoid spread okay lots

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:29.370
of single melanocytes that are atypical and
have kind of a grayish pink cytoplasm and

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:34.490
they're spreading all the way up scattering
all the way up into the even all the way up

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:38.440
to the granule layer and into the corneal
layer where they then die and get kind of

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.840
trapped in the dead keratin and you can see
that there are also some nests that are Pagetoid

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:48.510
whole nests that are breaking free from the
basal layer of the skin and spreading upwards

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:53.770
into the epidermis okay so some people described
this as a buckshot pattern also where it looks

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:59.140
like a like a shotgun shot upwards into the
epidermis and sprayed individual little pellets

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:04.370
of buckshot into the epidermis okay so that's
again dramatic pagetoid spread remember that

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:08.920
acral nevi sometimes will have Pagetoid spread
and occasionally it can even be pronounced

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:14.160
but we see other things here this is very
psychologically atypical we have really large

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:25.550
nucleoli kind of that see if I can find it
here we have large atypical nuclei with prominent

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:29.590
nucleoli and look what we also have here's
a nest that's actually down I think in the

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:34.740
papillary dermis and look what we have right
in the middle we have a mitosis so dermal

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:41.770
mitoses are another worrisome finding in melanocytic
lesions particularly if there are many mitosis

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:48.440
particularly if they are a typical mitotic
figures like tri-polar mitosis or asymmetric

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:55.400
mitosis that that look atypical and also particularly
if you see mitosis in the deep aspect the

00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:00.570
down in the deep dermal portion of a thick
melanocytic lesion okay so I've definitely

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:07.030
seen nevi on a regular basis that might have
one mitosis particularly in the superficial

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:12.530
dermal portion of the lesion but if you start
seeing multiple mitosis that's a time to stop

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:17.800
and worry about melanoma particularly if you
have atypia pagetoid spread other features

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.650
if I have an atypical melanocytic lesion that
I'm worried about melanoma and then I see

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:26.560
a dermal mitosis that usually is kind of a
feature that will push me over the edge into

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:31.940
deciding yes this is melanoma if I'm on the
line and uncertain having a mitosis in addition

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:37.280
to other atypical features it's very helpful
I mean obviously a case like this once you

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.800
have some experience in Derm path this from
the second you put this slide on the scope

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:46.780
you say this is going to be a melanoma it's
a pretty easy really classic dramatic example

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:54.150
okay and here another thing we can look at
this case and talk about is maturation okay

00:21:54.150 --> 00:22:01.510
maturation is somewhat of a complicated topic
to talk about let's go to lower power here

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.820
what we generally see in nevi and again go
back to the nevus video if you’ve not watched

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:11.940
it yet is we see that as when we have a metastatic
lesion that has a dermal component either

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:19.010
a compound nevus or an intradermal nevus if
we look at the melanocytes in the superficial

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:23.510
dermis the papillary dermis we’ll usually
find larger melanocytes that have more abundant

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:29.710
cytoplasm and are arranged in larger nests
as we go deeper down into the dermis the melanocytes

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:35.390
themselves get smaller they have less cytoplasm
their nuclei tend to get smaller and the nests

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:39.190
that they’re in tend to get smaller and
even the cells start getting arranged as little

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:45.140
single cells that trickle down into the dermis
so that pattern is called maturation or zonation

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:49.960
some people say and this the term maturation
goes all the way back to I believe Dr. Unna

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:54.420
in the eighteen late 1800s came up with this
idea and the theory was that nevi start as

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:59.990
junctional things and then move down into
the dermis and mature and we now I think biologically

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:03.570
understand that that's not actually what’s
happening in nevi but the term maturation

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:07.870
is so widely used and understood in derm path
that we still use it even though it's probably

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:14.430
not technically accurate at a scientific level
okay but it certainly is a useful tool morphologically

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:18.320
to determine if you’re dealing with or to
one of the points that you can use to determine

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:24.260
if you’re dealing with a melanoma or a nevus
so at first glance this lesion may seem to

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:29.280
have maturation it’s got large nests of
large cells up here and as you go deeper the

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.450
nests and the cells seem to get a little bit
smaller so this is again why maturation even

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:37.740
though we find it useful it’s sometimes
kind of complicated because it’s not as

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:42.690
easy to evaluate particularly for beginning
pathologists but I'll tell you one thing that

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:47.910
I find really helpful is obviously if you
see large nests of large cells down to the

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:52.540
deep part of a lesion that is one feature
that might be worrisome for melanoma and I'll

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:56.940
go look closer for other things but what we
can see here this again is obvious there's

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:03.610
cytologic atypia very atypical melanocytes
here they’re large they have kind of hyperchromasia

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:11.320
some of them we see mitotic figures multiple
layers of mitosis over here but look as we

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.840
go down even though the nest gets smaller
the melanocytes are still very large and atypical

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:20.390
and they have nucleoli even down here at the
deep part I feel like that's one helpful thing

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:24.720
if I have a lesion that looks kind of funny
and I look down at the deepest portion of

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:29.751
the lesion deepest portion of the melanocytic
lesion in the deep dermis or deeper down in

00:24:29.751 --> 00:24:34.340
the dermis and look at the nuclei if the nuclei
are still large and there are still prominent

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.490
nucleoli even down deep to me that's a sign
that maybe the lesion doesn't have normal

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:42.830
maturation so even though it does seem to
get a little the cells get a little smaller

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:47.710
and the nests get smaller we still have pretty
atypical cells and pretty large cells down

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:51.820
here at the deep aspect of the lesion and
also you may have noticed we passed over a

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:56.580
couple mitoses here's one right here again
so we have multiple dermal mitoses in the

00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:00.740
dermal melanocytes in this case and it can
also be a little challenging sometimes to

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:05.320
tell if the dermal melanocytes are I'm sorry
the dermal mitoses are actually in melanocytes

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:10.260
or not if you see you know sometimes mitoses
will if there's a lot of inflammation you

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:15.280
can see mitotic figures in the inflammatory
cells or in dividing endothelial cells if

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:19.830
there's some granulation tissue or reactive
vessels around but here when you see a mitosis

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:23.690
that’s right in the middle of a nest of
melanocytes there's no doubt about that that’s

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:29.870
a mitosis in a dermal melanocytes and that
is a very worrisome sign for melanoma when

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:34.120
there are many of them and when there are
other atypical features present so again here

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:39.900
we are down at the deepest aspect of the lesion
and as we look along we still see pretty large

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:45.000
very atypical cells even down here at the
deep aspect and I think here's an area where

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.970
I thought somewhere on here there was a good
area that yeah here’s an area I think that's

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:57.320
helpful to seethes looking in the papillary
dermis here we see large nests of large cells

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:02.410
and as we go down they still tend to be pretty
large even as we move down into the dermis

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:06.661
still large cells still large nests they do
start to trickle out down here and again that

00:26:06.661 --> 00:26:11.830
could give you the impression that there's
normal maturation at low power but at higher

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:24.360
power these cells are clearly atypical big
nucleoli large nuclei atypical nuclei even

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:29.800
down at the deep aspect of the lesion so maturation
is a helpful feature but it only works on

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:34.250
lesions where you have a dermal component
of melanocytes you can't use that the word

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:39.760
maturation when you're talking about junctional
nevus versus melanoma in situ okay so in those

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:44.900
kinds of cases you only can look at the epidermal
features the features that that melanocytic

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:50.120
lesions have in the epidermis maturation only
works if there's a dermal component okay so

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:54.060
you can't use that rule when you’re trying
to decide something to melanoma in situ or

00:26:54.060 --> 00:27:02.380
not all right so that's another example of
atypia of pagetoid spread and of abnormal

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:20.850
maturation in a melanoma now here's a scar
this is a dermal scar and the reason is that

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:26.950
this is a melanoma that was biopsied and then
the margins were positive and they comeback

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:32.750
and they did a wide local excision around
it and here's the residual melanoma that's

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:37.940
left over here and again this is just an example
of really dramatic Pagetoid spread with lots

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:44.610
of atypical melanocytes scattering upwards
into the superficial aspect of the epidermis

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:49.240
and this is in this melanoma doesn’t have
much pigment at all right the cells are very

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:55.310
pale grayish cytoplasm and this is a little
bit older slide that's a touch faded but still

00:27:55.310 --> 00:28:00.559
you can tell that there's really no melanin
pigment production here okay so when the melanin

00:28:00.559 --> 00:28:05.429
pigment is present it's helpful and actually
even though I've just said that now I've been

00:28:05.429 --> 00:28:09.010
proven wrong when you look really close I
don't know if it’ll pick up on the video

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:14.130
there are actually really tiny little bits
and pieces of melanin in some of these cells

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:21.650
very subtle and focal and if you have doubts
in a case like this and you’re not sure

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:26.100
if these are melanocytes or not you know it's
Pagetoid you know it’s atypical you know

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:30.310
it must be malignant but you're not sure are
these melanocytes or could this be Paget’s

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:35.710
disease could this be squamous in situ I think
much of the time you can decide that on H&amp;E

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:41.080
alone but when you need help you can use melanocytic
markers to help sort out that differential

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:47.880
so Mart-1 or SOX10 will stay in the melanocytes
but will be negative in Pagetoid squamous

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:53.309
cell carcinoma in situ and in Paget's disease
of the nipple or extra memory Paget’s disease

00:28:53.309 --> 00:28:57.760
so you can use a variety of different immunostains
to help you here again is a nice example of

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:04.072
nuclear atypia with a really large melanocyte
with a huge nucleolus and then that's a nice

00:29:04.072 --> 00:29:13.760
example of Pagetoid spread so this is another
example of a superficial spreading pattern

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:20.910
of melanoma in this case is actually just
melanoma in situ and most of the time for

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:24.570
melanoma insight to I just say melanoma in
situ and I don't actually put down a subtype

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:29.890
with the exception of the lentigo maligna
subtype because those do tend to spread farther

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:35.070
to the side and often times require a wider
margin or more stages on Mohs surgery if Mohs

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:39.681
is being used and so I think a lot of times
the treating physicians like to know that

00:29:39.681 --> 00:29:44.530
information so when I have lentigo maligna
even on a melanoma in situ I do tend to say

00:29:44.530 --> 00:30:01.010
that I think and that's just my personal practice
all right so here's another example of a melanoma

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:06.590
on acral skin and this this really dark stuff
here by the way this is just an air bubble

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:10.010
underneath the slide that's right on top of
the keratinocytes it's not important so if

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:13.160
you’re if you're a beginner watching this
just know that's all that is if you see that

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:17.559
real dark line it's not melanin this stuff
the dark stuff you're seeing here that’s

00:30:17.559 --> 00:30:24.720
actually melanin okay so here’s an acral
lesion a large acral lesion on the sole of

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:34.450
the foot okay well we can see right here actually
in the dermis there’s a nevus here so this

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:40.020
nevus has probably been present for a long
time all of these cells in the dermis they’re

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:44.000
they're maturing nicely they’re starting
up here and then going down a maturing and

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.250
getting smaller but in the epidermis we see
something else going on we see some Pagetoid

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:54.670
spread which you can have in acral nevi but
we also see pretty large atypical melanocytes

00:30:54.670 --> 00:31:01.130
here and in acral sites what I like to see
to make a diagnosis of acral lentiginous melanoma

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:06.720
ideally I like to see severe cytologic atypia
and confluent growth now we don't always get

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:11.720
that and sometimes the edges of a large acral
lentiginous melanoma if they biopsy near the

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:17.130
edge it can sometimes be very subtle and so
this is why on acral pigmented lesions I really

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:22.020
like to know the size of the lesion if they're
biopsy a really tiny lesion and the biopsy

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:28.010
probably is showing most of what of the lesion
clinically you know it's lesions three or

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:31.920
four millimeters and they've done a shave
biopsy or a punch biopsy well in that case

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:36.390
then I feel pretty reassured that what I'm
dealing was probably not a melanoma it's not

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:41.470
that you cannot have small melanomas you can
but on acral skin the thing that worries me

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:44.760
is that I’m getting a small biopsy of a
large lesion so if you're a dermatologist

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:49.700
watching this or a family doc or anybody who
does biopsies please remember this one thing

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:55.240
if you're going to biopsy melanocytic lesions
either try to biopsy the whole lesion or if

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:58.780
you think that you should need to take about
a partial biopsy of a big lesion sometimes

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:04.850
that's needed I would caution against it unless
you absolutely have to but in that case please

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:08.710
tell the pathologist put it on the requisition
sheet this is a partial biopsy of a three

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:13.950
centimeter plaque on the bottom of the foot
that black that is incredibly helpful information

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:20.600
for us and can help save the patient and everyone
involved from a potential misdiagnosis okay

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:26.679
so on acral melanocytic things I like to know
the size and make sure I'm not missing something

00:32:26.679 --> 00:32:30.200
in any case this is a big excision because
this was already a biopsy proven melanoma

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:36.070
so there was Nevus there but there's also
melanoma melanomas arise in nevi on a relatively

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:40.770
regular basis I mean the risk of a Nevus turning
the melanoma is very low people most people

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:45.230
have multiple nevi and most people do not
ever get melanoma so the risk is low but we

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:50.971
do see melanoma next to nevi on a regular
basis in my practice okay the reason I’m

00:32:50.971 --> 00:32:56.500
showing this is the acral lentiginous melanoma
is the best type of melanoma to show confluent

00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:03.240
growth okay so confluent growth is a feature
that we look at as worrisome in a melanocytic

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:09.929
lesion nevi usually have individual either
nests or sometimes single melanocytes in the

00:33:09.929 --> 00:33:14.830
epidermal junction at the basal layer but
they’re spaced out from one another by normal

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:18.600
intervening keratinocytes okay that’s the
way normal melanocytes grow and that’s the

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:23.980
way Nevi tend to grow melanoma sometimes though
will overgrow in the epidermis and sometimes

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:29.100
they spread upwards and that's pagetoid and
sometimes they spread out to the sides and

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:33.170
replace the basal layer with melanocytes they
push the keratinocytes out of the way and

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:44.710
we call that confluence or conflagration it
can be kind of challenging to evaluate microscopically

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:47.850
it's easy for us in derm path to talk about
that feature but it's actually kind of hard

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:52.630
I think to pick up on how to how to diagnose
it so I think that acral melanomas are usually

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:56.830
show really dramatic confluent growth and
so they’re a good place to start when we're

00:33:56.830 --> 00:34:01.560
talking about this pattern okay so here and
this again I told you earlier that usually

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:05.560
they’re really darkly pigmented cells are
not melanocytes well here's me being proven

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.760
wrong sometimes they are I feel like acral
melanomas have a tendency to have more pigment

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:13.360
I don't know if that’s really true but in
my experience they seem to up more often be

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:18.540
darkly pigmented melanocytes than than other
types of melanomas so up here we have some

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:22.560
Pagetoid cells and along the basal layer here
these guys even though they have a lot of

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:27.550
pigment these are actually all melanocytes
and if you did a stain for Mart -1 or SOX10

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:33.310
they'd almost all be positive and they've
basically completely replaced the basal layer

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:37.780
like there are almost no keratinocytes left
in here all you see are melanocytes with very

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:41.810
maybe there's a rare keratinocyte left in
here but almost the entire basal layer is

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:47.220
replaced by atypical melanocytes that's called
confluent growth and that's a worrisome sign

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:53.230
for melanoma particularly if it's really prominent
sometimes an irritated nevi or particularly

00:34:53.230 --> 00:35:00.060
Nevi that have been biopsied and then re grown
over top of the scar recurrent Nevi they can

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:05.119
have pretty striking confluent growth and
yet are still benign so again every single

00:35:05.119 --> 00:35:09.010
rule I'm going to teach you here today is
going to have possible times when it can be

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:15.400
broken okay so recurrent nevi can look and
also really irritated or scratched excoriated

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:20.640
and nevi that have regrown into the epidermis
over top of the area of injury they can have

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:25.340
what looks like confluent but a confluent
growth but here we have mark cytologic atypia

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:31.540
and other features for melanoma but this solid
line of melanocytes replacing the basal layer

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:36.140
that’s confluent growth and that's a really
helpful feature for melanoma okay and as I

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:41.410
think is like the best example of confluent
growth in my collection let’s see if I can

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:56.780
find the other area without the slide falling
here I'm going to turn it around

00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:04.950
here this is a really great example really
dramatic example so the confluent growth starts

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:09.240
down here in the Rete ridges and moves all
the way up the side of the Rete all the way

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:14.619
along here so down here the melanocytes don't
have much pigment up here they do but they're

00:36:14.619 --> 00:36:18.660
all melanocytes and if you did a stain it
would prove that and you can see a solid line

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:24.500
of atypical melanocytes basically replacing
the entire basal layer of the epidermis okay

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:29.960
so that's going to fluent growth and that
is a really helpful feature when it's present

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:35.030
for melanoma now I often times melanomas don't
have confluent growth so just because it doesn’t

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:38.960
have confluent growth doesn’t mean that
it's benign but if you see confluent girth

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:46.120
you should be really worried about the possibility
of melanoma okay and again these have really

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:51.210
large nucleoli they're atypical cytologically
it's a little hard to seethe nucleoli or the

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:55.980
nuclei and the nuclear features and some of
them because of all the extra melanin pigment

00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:01.840
that they have but they're quite atypical
alright and one thing that’s helpful a helpful

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:07.170
clue for confluent growth is this what's happening
here is the epidermis looks like it's separating

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:12.220
from the dermis it's like a blister almost
like a little a little sub-epidermal cleft

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:16.980
or separation looks almost like what we see
in small blisters in in inflammatory Bullous

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:22.260
dermatosis so if you see a blister again I'm
using air quotes here if you see a blister

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:27.890
what looks like a blister or a cleft or like
the epidermis is unzipping itself from the

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:32.760
underlying dermis in the midst of a melanocytic
lesion that you have to think about melanoma

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:37.470
until you can prove otherwise because that's
a worrisome sign and what this is an artifact

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:42.020
and my understanding of why this probably
happens is that there are so many melanocytes

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:47.130
growing along here pushing the keratinocytes
out of the way that when we process the tissue

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:51.420
in formalin and the other chemicals we use
to fix the tissue there's sometimes some shrinkage

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:57.150
of the tissue and the epidermis normally is
held tightly to the dermis by the Hemidesmosomes

00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:02.510
and all of their adhesion molecules that hook
on to the basement membrane we don’t have

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:07.180
that here because most of the keratinocytes
have been pushed out of the way by melanocytes

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:11.540
melanocytes do not have those same adhesion
molecules they do not attach down to the basement

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:16.400
membrane so the epidermis starts to cleft
and lift away so this is not like an actual

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:20.500
blister in the patient it's a artifact that
we see microscopically kind of like the cleft

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:25.330
an artifact that we see in basal cell carcinomas
it's an artifact but it's a useful artifact

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:30.320
because it’s a clue to confluent growth
and it's a clue to melanoma in the context

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:35.280
of a melanocytic lesion okay so when you see
that now I've seen times where there’s splits

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:38.530
like this that are just due to tears in the
tissue or something so it's not that every

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:43.700
time you see this cleft it's always melanoma
but you should really stop and think about

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:48.510
melanoma when you see this sign right here
the unzipping sign or the melanocytic blistering

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:54.600
sign it's an artifact that's really useful
okay so confluent growth like I said is often

00:38:54.600 --> 00:39:00.180
not nearly as dramatic as we see in this case
of acral melanoma but I think this is a good

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:06.640
example of a really classic really ideal example
of confluence and here's more of it over here

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:11.250
with that same look again that blistering
artifact or the unzipping sign where the epidermis

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:16.130
and the dermis are starting to separate from
one another because of overgrowth of the melanocytes

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:20.850
replacing the basal layer keratinocytes another
feature that you can use when you're trying

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:25.220
to decide if something is confluent is look
for the adnexal structures and this again

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:30.410
is particularly true in acral lentiginous
melanomas they have this really strong tendency

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:35.800
to grow down the eccrine ducts and so here's
eccrine duct and there away I can tell is

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:40.080
it's a little a little structure made of keratinocyte
like cells and in the center there's a little

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:44.970
tiny hole that you can barely see here and
it's lined by a little pink cuticle you just

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:49.450
barely see it so we're cut kind of at an angle
so you can't see a perfect empty lumen in

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:53.480
the middle but this is a duct and look what
these are the these are the epithelial cells

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:58.609
of the duct that look a lot like keratinocytes
and then around the outside we have large

00:39:58.609 --> 00:40:05.640
atypical melanocytes completely wrapping and
replacing the basal layer of the ductal epithelial

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:10.130
cells so sometimes when you can’t when you're
not sure if there’s confluent growth in

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:14.620
the epidermis looking and seeing if you're
having single-cell confluent growth down the

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:19.140
eccrine ducts are down hair follicles can
be incredibly useful and I’ve definitely

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:23.390
had times where that feature was what helped
me make the diagnosis of melanoma in this

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:28.800
case I think has some other examples let me
find we find another place here's another

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.490
duct and now that one you definitely can see
there's a nice lumen in the middle there so

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:36.910
this is an eccrine duct and again it's not
completely wrapped by atypical melanocytes

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:41.600
but you can definitely see single atypical
melanocytes that are spreading down into the

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:46.740
duct and replacing the basal layer and sometimes
they can be so florid that they can replace

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:52.260
most of the epithelial cells in the sweat
duct okay and in that case they can kind of

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:56.920
be mistaken for invasion actually you can
like look at this here you could say oh this

00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:01.600
is a nest of invasive melanoma well actually
there are probably some keratinocytes or I’m

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.990
sorry some epithelial cells left inhere so
this is probably actually in situ spread down

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:10.520
a duct so you wouldn’t want to measure that
as an invasive area in a melanoma now this

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:15.130
melanoma has other areas like this that are
definitely invasive we see atypical melanocytes

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:18.190
that are invading the dermis and again it's
a little hard here because look at all the

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:23.270
pigment and a lot of these really darkly pigmented
cells are actually Melanophages whereas these

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:26.650
cells that have a little bit more of that
dirty grayish cytoplasm even though they have

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:30.420
some pigment they’re not nearly like as
these are like so dark brown that they almost

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:35.150
look black these are melanophages these are
melanocytes sometimes the nuclear features

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:39.310
can help you sometimes seeing the grayish
cytoplasm can help if you’re really struggling

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:45.320
to tell if the dermal cells are melanocytes
versus Melanophages do an immunostain and

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:48.150
that can really help solve the problem and
that’s really important because if they're

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:53.580
just Melanophages then you might have a melanoma
in situ but no invasive growth and if they're

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:57.170
melanoma cells in the dermis and then you
have invasion and that's going to change the

00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:01.260
treatment and potentially change the prognosis
for the patient so it’s important to make

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:06.230
that distinction here’s another example
of a duct kind of funny where we've got here's

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:12.680
the epithelial cells in the middle and atypical
melanocytes are on the outside one other thing

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:22.050
I guess that I'll say before we move on about
confluent growth is that it doesn't always

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:28.240
it doesn’t always work so so clearly as
I showed in the previous area but what I start

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:32.460
to worry about is that a lot of times Nevi
will have nests of melanocytes down the tips

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:39.869
of Rete and when I start to see single melanocytes
crawling up in-between the inter-Rete space

00:42:39.869 --> 00:42:46.090
the area over top of the dermal papilla over
or the papillae if we're saying multiple if

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:50.300
you start to see a lot of melanocytes filling
this space in here that starts to worry me

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:54.180
that we're getting into confluent growth now
that's a again that's kind of a subtle thing

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:59.150
that can be hard to interpret I definitely
see some single melanocytes in the inter-Rete

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:03.310
space in benign nevi on a regular basis but
if that’s one thing I look for if I’m

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:07.240
having a hard time with the lesion I start
looking and seeing are there very many cells

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:11.430
growing in that space because again that's
the idea that the that the melanocytes are

00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:16.520
starting to get a little bit too rambunctious
and are growing upwards and starting to replace

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:24.220
parts of the basal layer so like here look
at this we're starting to see single melanocytes

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:28.470
kind of coming inhere by itself that's not
enough for melanoma I think but it's a sign

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:32.840
that makes me start to wonder and worry a
little bit and then over here I know it’s

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:38.160
upside down but you can again see complete
replacement of the basal layer by atypical

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:43.280
melanocytes and that’s obvious confluent
growth so I hope that helps you understand

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:48.130
confluence a little bit better and I admit
it's kind of a tricky topic but if you do

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:53.310
an immunostain what it'll look like is like
a kid took a crayon and colored a solid line

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:58.700
right along the basal layer it just completely
replaces most of the basal layer of the epidermis

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:08.150
when you have really dramatic confluence 
now look here's an example where the entire

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:12.590
epidermis is basically missing and this is
also from Acral scanning this is a large worrisome

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:17.270
lesion clinically a punch biopsy was done
because it was so large that it wouldn’t

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:24.730
have been feasible to remove the whole thing
thankfully the dermatologist was very clear

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:29.270
about that and said that this is a partial
biopsy have a large worrisome lesion and here

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:33.230
you can see one little fragment of epidermis
but it's totally detached so it's hard to

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:37.470
evaluate a melanocytic lesion when the whole
epidermis is gone right because I can't look

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:42.950
for Pagetoid spread really I can't look for
confluent growth but wouldn't I see on a typical

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:46.940
melanocytic lesion if then this is not a common
finding but when I see something like this

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:50.790
that instantly worries me that maybe there's
confluent growth that's so confluent that

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:58.400
the whole epidermis has artifactually detached
during processing of the tissue and is floated

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:03.410
away and look we can sea a typical melanocytes
right in this space where the basal layer

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:07.540
would have been but we just can't see any
epidermis with it certainly the cytologic

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:13.980
there's cytologic atypia down in the dermal
component to some degree but the cells also

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:18.620
kind of have a little bit of a nevoid appearance
I kind of have a nevus like look so it could

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:21.940
be really challenging and here it matters
because look how thick this lesion is it goes

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:26.140
down into the dermis so if this is melanoma
versus a nevus that’s a big difference for

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:36.230
the patient here look what we have right hermit’s
a little bit hard to see on this section but

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:41.500
right here's a sweat duct and there's a little
tiny lumen in the middle and if I did a keratin

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:46.350
stain those cells in the center would stain
and around the outside we have complete wrapping

00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:53.000
of the duct with very atypical melanocytes
so this is confluent growth all the way down

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.040
and we're way down in the dermis look at this
it's really amazing to me how acral melanomas

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:03.500
tend to do this we're way down here and we
have actually this is not invasive but melanoma

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:10.140
in situ to within the sweat duct epithelium
so here that actually is a feature that would

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:14.470
really be helpful and confirming the diagnosis
but look the other piece actually shows us

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:19.220
that what we suspect that is exactly what’s
happening here is the Melanocytic lesion and

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:24.740
you can see this cleft this split the blister
here which is artifactual from the confluent

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:30.940
growth of melanocytes along the dermal epidermal
Junction and there is cytologic atypia there

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:36.031
really hyper-chromatic atypical melanocytes
and there's Pagetoid spread lots of Pagetoid

00:46:36.031 --> 00:46:44.450
spread and if we lookover here to the side
this area is not quite as dramatic but we

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:49.910
do begin to see some single cells moving up
in the inter-Rete space along the basal layer

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:57.450
in the space between Rete ridges and look
what else we see here's an acral syringoma

00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:03.650
is the swirly spirally opening of where the
eccrine duct deposits sweat out onto the skin

00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:07.950
surface and there it’s the best place to
see them as in acral skin they're really dramatic

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:12.880
there and look what we have right below it
we have the sweat duct here's the lumen of

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:17.560
the duct right here it's got a little hole
there there's a little pink lining and what’s

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:23.480
this all melanoma cells completely replacing
the basal layer and most of the epithelium

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:27.500
of the sweat duct so this is what we saw on
the other piece this is what it looks like

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:32.090
up at the top the cells have tracked all the
way down that duct way down into the deep

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:37.990
dermis and so again finding that is a really
helpful clue for melanoma so all of this here

00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:45.410
is invasive melanoma and I've even occasionally
I don't think this case has but I've even

00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:49.450
occasionally seen melanoma in situ all the
way down into eccrine coils way down and it’s

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:54.430
important again to recognize if it’s actually
in the sweat ducts or glands that’s in situ

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:58.520
that's not invasion you don't want to measure
that okay that will give you a deeper breslow

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:07.440
than is actually real here's an example again
of complete separation of the epidermis from

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:12.420
the dermis a complete looks like a sub-epidermal
blister but it's all do it's an artifact due

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:21.820
to that confluent melanocytes atypical melanocytes
in the dermis and this is the one where we

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:27.502
have dramatic in situ melanoma all the way
down here here's the duct cut kind of at a

00:48:27.502 --> 00:48:30.760
funny angle so that's why it looks like it’s
got little septations there it’s actually

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:36.089
just a swirly kind of spiral of the duct that's
cut funny all of this is melanoma in situ

00:48:36.089 --> 00:48:39.370
replacing it and in this case is a little
odd that in addition to melanoma in situ there

00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:43.970
actually are single cells of invasive melanoma
that have also tracked along the duct out

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:48.510
in the dermis though they’re out in the
dermis so outside of the the epithelium so

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:52.849
there's both in situ and invasive melanoma
around these ducts which is kind of weird

00:48:52.849 --> 00:48:57.800
but it’s a really great example though of
how dramatically you can have melanoma in

00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:01.400
sites you spread down ducts in a confluent
fashion and that can really help make the

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:07.070
diagnosis of melanoma in challenging cases
so breslow depth is normally measured the

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:11.530
way we measure it is we measure from the top
of the granular layer so not the top of the

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:16.140
corneal layer but the top of the granular
layer and we measure all the way down to the

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:20.140
deepest part of melanoma so we'd start here
and we measure down here and usually we have

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:24.810
an eyepiece that you can't see on the screen
but that we can see here sitting at the microscope

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:29.240
it's a micrometer and in the ocular of the
microscope that lets us measure and we report

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:33.859
it in millimeters and in a case like this
where there's artifactual split I would make

00:49:33.859 --> 00:49:39.230
a measurement from here to here and I might
measure several areas this area over here

00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:44.099
actually is probably deeper and in fact since
we had stuff down deep we probably could measure

00:49:44.099 --> 00:49:47.320
all the way here but that's a little bit more
complicated just for the point of it say this

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:51.160
was the deepest part of the lesion you would
start at the granular layer you would go down

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:55.109
to the deepest place in the lesion and if
you have an artifact like this a little split

00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:58.510
subtract that amount out because that’s
not really there in the patient so if there's

00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:02.510
that might be a little a little tiny area
that it won't really change much but I usually

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:06.500
will subtract that out if there's an artifact
like that okay so you measure from the top

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:10.270
of the granular layer to the deepest point
of invasion and again stuff like this is not

00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:14.200
usually seen in melanoma it's kind of complicated
so we won't really go into how to deal with

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:19.300
that all right but anyway that's the basics
of breslow that's the basics of confluent

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:29.450
growth a really good example now this is changing
gears a little bit here we have a biopsy of

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:35.000
a pigmented lesion from the face of an elderly
person and you can tell it’s probably the

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:40.290
face because there's lots of large sebaceous
glands and prominent hair follicles okay so

00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:44.550
as patients age they tend to get prominent
sebaceous glands and sebaceous hyperplasia

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:51.500
on their face but this is a dark lesion in
the patient's old and sun-damaged okay so

00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:57.410
clinically they're concerned is this lentigo
or a seborrhoeic keratosis or is this an atypical

00:50:57.410 --> 00:51:05.820
nevus or is this a melanoma on the sun-damaged
face of old people my thought process is if

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:10.870
I see melanocytes there I want to think about
melanoma until I can prove that it's not it’s

00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:16.840
not that you can't have nevi on the face of
old sun damage people you can but it's far

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:21.849
more worrisome that I'm gonna miss a melanoma
if I'm not being cautious because sometimes

00:51:21.849 --> 00:51:26.490
the melanomas that occur on sun damaged elderly
skin particularly on the head and neck can

00:51:26.490 --> 00:51:31.960
be very subtle at first glance and so this
type of melanoma is called Lentigo maligna

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:37.040
it's called that because it looks a lot like
solar lentigo clinically but it behaves if

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:40.830
you leave it alone for many years it will
often behave badly sometimes it can behave

00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:45.599
badly even more rapidly but a lot of times
it will grow for a long time and then eventually

00:51:45.599 --> 00:51:50.890
become aggressive so what we see in this case
there's a lot of pigment right well solar

00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:55.780
lentigo would look like that too it can have
elongated Rete that are hyper-pigmented so

00:51:55.780 --> 00:52:00.940
when you see these it's important to look
a little more closely if you see nests or

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:05.839
a significant number of atypical melanocytes
you should be very worried about the possibility

00:52:05.839 --> 00:52:13.960
of melanoma in situ Okay Lentigo maligna and
one thing that helps me is if I see this I

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:18.900
see kind of a jumbling of grayish looking
cells along the basal layer and it can be

00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:22.710
quite hard in cases that have a lot of pigment
like this one but here when I start seeing

00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:26.740
an increased number of cells that are kind
of large and of gray cytoplasm that worries

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:32.380
me now if that's all I had here doing an immunostain
would be potentially very useful and I personally

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:37.600
like to use SOX10 and I like the red chromogen
if you're able to have that because it will

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:40.690
help you in cases like this where there's
lots of brown pigment it’ll help you to

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:45.980
distinguish what’s true staining of melanocytes
nuclei versus background pigment okay but

00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:52.530
if you don't have that MiTF also works although
I only personally like to use MiTF if for

00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:56.660
melanoma in situ and I don’t ever like to
use it for invasive melanoma or metastatic

00:52:56.660 --> 00:53:01.390
melanoma because it’s relatively nonspecific
in my experience it will often stain histiocytes

00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:06.070
so if you have MiTF I think it works okay
for melanoma in situ but I don’t like to

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:10.570
use it for melanoma in any other context personally
I think it’s actually kind of dangerous

00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:16.140
and to look at lymph nodes or distant Mets
and try to use MiTF there so anyway we can

00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:20.810
have another video about melanocytic Immunostains
but I personally like SOX10 Mart-1 is okay

00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:24.920
too but it will stain the dendritic processes
of melanocytes and it can tend to make you

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:29.020
over-interpret how many melanocytes are there
so see down here we're starting to see actually

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:33.550
little clusters of single melanocytes even
though they're darkly pigmented or blended

00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:39.099
in with darkly pigmented keratinocytes there
probably are melanocytes down here when an

00:53:39.099 --> 00:53:43.760
immunostain indeed actually confirmed that
you can see here we're starting to get little

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:49.550
clusters so again what I’m showing you though
on H and E here is kind of challenging but

00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:53.240
the reason I’m going to show you this one
is A so that you remember that Lentigo maligna

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:57.720
malignant can be very subtle sometimes and
hard total and B there are some clues that

00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:04.240
help number one look down the adnexa so at
this this is a hair follicle and what are

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:09.260
all these gray atypical cells this is all
melanoma these are melanoma and site two cells

00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:14.050
they’re not nearly as pigmented as the ones
at the junction but they're growing all the

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:18.060
way down replacing the basal layer of the
hair follicle even spreading out into the

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:23.589
sebaceous glands completely in confluent growth
pattern all the way way down into this follicle

00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:29.250
look we're still still going down here all
of that stuff all melanoma in situ all of

00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:34.450
this melanoma in situ is spreading out into
a sebaceous gland now sometimes you can see

00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:39.839
nests of melanocytes like in congenital nevi
that are in the middle of a sebaceous gland

00:54:39.839 --> 00:54:43.810
or a hair follicle but when you see single-cell
growth of atypical melanocytes down a hair

00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:49.290
follicle or down sweat ducts replacing the
basal layer that’s a worrisome site particularly

00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:55.221
if you’re looking at a pigmented melanocytic
lesion from elderly sun damaged skin and look

00:54:55.221 --> 00:54:59.780
you can see the same thing happening over
here it's not nearly as dramatic but there

00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:05.270
are atypical melanocytes spreading down here
and spreading over here and so this is extra

00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:13.230
evidence of confluent growth the lentigo maligna
type of melanoma in situ doesn't have as dramatic

00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:16.650
of confluent growth much of the time it ‘s
often kind of skippy growth where you’ll

00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:21.240
see nests and single cells and then spaces
with very little melanocytes and then more

00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:25.619
melanocytes and it keeps kind of skipping
all the way along and it’s usually kind

00:55:25.619 --> 00:55:30.810
of broad and we'll go from one end of the
biopsy to the other oftentimes let's look

00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:41.280
at this piece down here 
so here again is an example of a hair follicle

00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:48.560
and sebaceous gland with melanoma insight
to tracking down into the adnexal epithelium

00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:52.609
and here this is more obvious here at the
junction we actually are starting to see nests

00:55:52.609 --> 00:55:58.820
and zones of confluent growth of the melanocytes
and once you if you think you’ve got a solar

00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:03.190
lentigo but you start seeing nests actual
nests of melanocytes is not a solar lentigo

00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:07.900
there may be a solar lentigo there also but
you have to think once you have nest of melanocytes

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:11.820
you have a melanocytic lesion either it's
a nevus and maybe this person's had a little

00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:16.360
nevus their whole life and now they’re old
and sun damage or it's a melanoma and so that's

00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:20.310
the kind of time we got to be really careful
and I personally find that immunostains cane

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:23.970
helpful although you have to learn how to
use them because sun damaged skin tends to

00:56:23.970 --> 00:56:29.920
have an increased number of kind of large
melanocytes as a kind of melanocytic hyperplasia

00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:36.280
that gets induced by chronic UV exposure from
the Sun and so you do have to be careful any

00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:40.619
old Sun damaged person is going to have more
melanocytes and larger melanocytes than a

00:56:40.619 --> 00:56:46.500
younger non sun damaged person so you have
to get used to how to interpret the immunostains

00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:50.270
in that setting and if you’re watching this
in your say you're in private practice and

00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:54.680
don't see a lot of derm path take some skin
from a basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma

00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:58.640
excision where you know there's not probably
going to be any melanoma just background skin

00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:04.910
and do a SOX10 stain on a few cases to get
an idea of oh wow this is the density of melanocytes

00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:09.170
in that you see a lot of times an old Sun
damaged skin so I think that's helpful and

00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:13.920
that can give you kind of a threshold or help
you set your threshold for for what is an

00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:17.830
allowable amount of melanocytes versus what's
worrisome I think the most important thing

00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:24.010
to me is if I do see zones of confluence if
I see patchy skippy areas if I see nests and

00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:27.829
also if I see atypia all those things can
help me so this is a lentigo maligna its all

00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:32.520
melanoma in situ in this case is the lentigo
maligna pattern and these often are kind of

00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:40.200
broad and spread widely and so it can be sometimes
hard to get clear margins on them and here’s

00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:46.930
an example it's not from the same case but
here's a nice example actually of the staining

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:52.230
that you can see in lentigo maligna okay this
is actually a MART-1 stain it was a again

00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:56.829
it’s a stain I don't personally like to
use very often looking for melanoma in situ

00:57:56.829 --> 00:58:02.339
it's useful I think if if you're looking at
lymph nodes or metastatic lesions sometimes

00:58:02.339 --> 00:58:06.470
or if you’re looking for invasion it can
be helpful for insight too I prefer SOX10

00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:15.190
personally but it's still a good example there’s
Pagetoid Spread there and lookout here at

00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:17.930
the periphery this is the reason that I think
you got to be a little careful when you use

00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:23.210
Mart-1 look what we have here you can see
there’s strong staining of a cytoplasm but

00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:27.250
look also the melanocytes have little branching
dendritic processes that’s what they normally

00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:32.820
use to feed melanin that they produce into
their neighboring keratinocytes but what happens

00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:37.580
here is it makes each single melanocytes a
lot bigger and kind of broader than it is

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:43.060
actually because it of its cytoplasmic processes
so it can the mark one stain can make it look

00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:48.420
like there are more melanocytes there than
there actually are in the SOX10 or MiTF nuclear

00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:53.490
stains will just show you the nucleus of each
cell and I think it's a little easier to kind

00:58:53.490 --> 00:59:00.910
of quantify how many cells are really there
but sometimes it still works because you have

00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:07.829
areas like this where there's obviously prominent
Pagetoid spread and the basal layer is basically

00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:17.150
completely replaced by atypical melanocytes
so this is melanoma and lentigo maligna sometimes

00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:21.440
will have Pagetoid spread oftentimes it doesn’t
though or has very little so don’t expect

00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:25.490
to always see Pagetoid Spread for a limb to
go malignant and then here's an area where

00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:29.670
there is actually a couple little tiny nests
of dermal invasion and so the Mart-1 help

00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:33.700
can help pick that up if you're if you’ve
got a lot of inflammation or background regression

00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:38.500
changes Mart-1 can sometimes be helpful to
show you a subtle focal invasion that's kind

00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:42.990
of hiding in the background so that's an example
of what immunostaining again I’ll make a

00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:51.930
video in the future I think showing immunostains
for melanocytic lesions in more detail now

00:59:51.930 --> 01:00:02.070
what I want to show for this lesion here here's
a melanoma again we've got focal areas like

01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:07.970
this I’ve confluent growth areas where there’s
melanocytes replacing much of the basal layer

01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:13.060
and spreading in between Rete but why I wash
to this case is because this is an example

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:19.090
of regression change okay regression is this
kind of response that happens in the dermis

01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:23.920
under a melanoma and it the theory is that
the melanoma invaded into that area of the

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:28.220
dermis and then the immune system destroyed
part of the melanoma and then kind of scar

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:33.670
tissue inflammation filled in that space now
in reality just because an area looks like

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:37.320
regression doesn’t necessarily mean there
was there used to be invasive melanoma there

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:42.440
sometimes we see regression like changes under
melanoma in situ in fact I see that relatively

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:47.360
often and I'm not totally sure that every
single one of those cases definitely had invasion

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:51.760
that’s now regressed it may just be kind
of a robust form of host immune system host

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:56.490
response against the tumor that’s happened
but the point is when I see this and see a

01:00:56.490 --> 01:01:01.710
significant amount of it like to report it
and it's one of the things that in the prognostic

01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:05.710
parameters that we often report for melanomas
although the significance is somewhat debatable

01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:09.821
people have argued that it's a bad thing or
that maybe it's a good thing and there have

01:01:09.821 --> 01:01:14.000
been people that have argued back and forth
so if I see it I usually will mention it in

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:20.099
my report but I think and I think it's an
important feature to recognize in melanomas

01:01:20.099 --> 01:01:24.450
what we usually see in regression are three
things we see disorganized collagen bundles

01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:29.380
collagen fibers we see lymphocytic we see
inflammation usually lymphocytes and sometimes

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:34.329
histiocytes and we often see pigment drop
out or pigment incontinence emollient of phages

01:01:34.329 --> 01:01:40.960
so here this disorganized pattern of collagen
fibers with intermingled lymphocytes and occasional

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:49.021
melanophages too this is good example of I
think regression change and sometimes there

01:01:49.021 --> 01:01:54.450
can be bunches of pigment in it sometimes
it’s very fibrotic sometimes it's very inflamed

01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:58.589
it just kind of depends on the individual
lesion of what stage it's abut look at low

01:01:58.589 --> 01:02:07.750
power to give you an example this is what
the kind of normal dermis looks like in this

01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:14.339
person you get the epidermis up top the papillary
dermis is normally filled with fine delicate

01:02:14.339 --> 01:02:23.609
collagen fibers and then the reticular dermis
has big thick bundles of collagen type 1 okay

01:02:23.609 --> 01:02:28.660
so that’s kind of the normal dermis and
then look over here see that zone of the papillary

01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:34.569
dermis has been totally replaced by this disorganized
fibrosis with thicker collagen bundles but

01:02:34.569 --> 01:02:39.270
not quite as thick as the reticular dermal
collagen and they're very disorganized and

01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:43.010
they're intermingled with inflammation and
they're not usually quite as organized as

01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:48.190
scar sometimes it can be hard to tell apart
scar from a previous biopsy versus regression

01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:53.420
change okay but it's a good thing to be familiar
with and know what regression looks like and

01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:56.550
also regressions a little bit in the eye of
the beholder too sometimes I'll think something

01:02:56.550 --> 01:03:00.730
looks like regression and a colleague might
say well I don't really think that’s necessarily

01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:07.640
regression it just kind of depends on the
your personal threshold all right in the last

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:11.020
main type of melanoma we're going to talk
about today is this one that I can’t even

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:17.390
get on the screens it's so big this is a nodular
melanoma right it's a big nodule huge nodule

01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:25.520
of tumor of melanoma it’s got a big ulcer
at the top and so ulceration is a bad prognostic

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:30.640
feature for melanomas usually melanomas that
are all serrated are all so thick and have

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:35.900
a lot of mitosis so they usually have a high
Breslow thickness and have mitotic activity

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:41.620
so they have other features that would be
bad also but that's I think part of why ulceration

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:46.030
is a bad sign is that it indicates the tumor
is growing really rapidly and those are tend

01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:51.180
to be tumors that end up end up being thick
and end up having lots of mitosis so we can

01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:56.790
see a big nodule of melanoma like this in
any type of melanoma you can see it in superficial

01:03:56.790 --> 01:04:02.790
spreading in lentigo maligna acral lentiginous
so just because there is a nodule of melanoma

01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:08.069
present does not mean that is nodular type
melanoma and I think this is kind of confusing

01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:11.150
and a little frustrating I thought it was
frustrating when I learned it as a resident

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:15.160
and I still don't fully understand why it's
so important that we have this strict rule

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:21.260
but what the rule is supposed to be is that
a nodular melanoma the invasive dermal component

01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:27.290
okay we're seeing here and the overlying in
situ melanoma component are aligned with each

01:04:27.290 --> 01:04:32.119
other you don't have in situ melanoma spreading
out to the side beyond the invasive dermal

01:04:32.119 --> 01:04:35.820
component so when we go to the edge of the
nodule here what we see is here’s the invasive

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:43.410
stuff all this is invasive melanoma down here
and here's in-situ melanoma up here and look

01:04:43.410 --> 01:04:47.710
the in situ stops right here the invasion
stops here if it goes more than like three

01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:53.089
rete beyond the edge if you can if you can
see in situ marching all the way out here

01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:58.400
multiple rete ridges beyond the end of the
dermal invasive component then usually it's

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:02.990
better to classify the lesion based on the
pattern of what the in situ looks like if

01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:06.960
there’s lots of pagetoid spread and large
epithelioid cells you can say it’s a superficial

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:11.650
spreading that just has a large nodule of
invasive melanoma that’s grown in it again

01:05:11.650 --> 01:05:16.790
I don't personally understand why this semantic
why this’s to me this seems like semantics

01:05:16.790 --> 01:05:20.510
and I don’t understand the importance I'm
sure somebody much smarter than me will come

01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:24.130
and tell me why I'm wrong but in any case
that's what the rules are supposed to be that

01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:28.890
the in-situ part doesn't go more than three
rete I think is the rule beyond the edge of

01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:33.720
the invasive stuff and if we look at the other
edge of the lesion here on the other side

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:38.620
wherever it is same thing we have in situ
stuff here and bassists up here and the end

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:42.349
of lesion is right there sorry it’s kind
of tipped at an angle but here’s the normal

01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:51.960
skin ah I dropped the slide into the microscope
all right here we’re looking at it kind

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:56.660
of at an angle now but there this is the normal
skin at the edge of the shave and here's where

01:05:56.660 --> 01:06:01.621
the melanoma starts and as you can tell this
is a lot a large polypoid melanoma huge and

01:06:01.621 --> 01:06:07.450
it's bulging out of the top of the skin and
so we see these sometimes and oftentimes these

01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:12.200
large nodular melanomas that are polypoid
tend to be ulcerated they tend to grow quickly

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:16.339
a lot of times they have very little pigment
in them and clinically they look like a big

01:06:16.339 --> 01:06:23.200
red ulcerated kind of friable nodule they
can look a lot like a pyogenic granuloma clinically

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:27.589
so that’s why most of my colleagues in dermatology
if they see something that looks like ape

01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:31.700
genic granuloma they'll usually biopsy it
just to make sure they're not missing one

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:37.440
of these kinds of lesions and here's an example
also of lack of maturation look at that the

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:44.560
whole dermis is filled with a uniform population
of melanocytes you don't even have to look

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:49.130
at high-power yet to see that you have huge
massive nests and they’re all packed really

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:53.660
tightly together with very little intervening
dermal collagen and the nests up here are

01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:58.750
big and large and as you go down there’s
still huge nests the whole lesion through

01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:07.100
it's like an entire solid sheet like packing
of nest together each nest is kind of a sheet

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:10.680
and all of the nests are packed closely together
and at the top of the lesion superficially

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:14.720
and the deepest aspect of the lesion it looks
almost identical let’s go to higher power

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:20.380
and look this one’s got a little bit of
a cracking artifact here in the midst of the

01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:33.079
tumor but I think we can still make the point
we have really atypical melanocytes big nucleoli

01:07:33.079 --> 01:07:41.190
kind of vesicular chromatin in this case if
you look around we’ll start finding mitosis

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:45.880
here's one right here and again usually big
modular melanomas like this of ulceration

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:50.460
are usually going to have many mitosis and
in melanoma we count the mitotic rate based

01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:55.550
on the dermal mitosis the mitosis that are
in the invasive melanoma component and we

01:07:55.550 --> 01:07:59.890
count in one millimeter squared and that's
different on every microscope we don't use

01:07:59.890 --> 01:08:04.890
the ten high-power fields like we use for
many other tumors so you have to know what

01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:11.470
the how many high-power fields represent a
millimeter square based on your microscope

01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:15.430
and there are some calculations online using
the field number of the objective and some

01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:20.279
other things to calculate how much area is
in high-power field on your given scope for

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:24.189
my personal scope it's like three and a half
high-power fields but again you can't use

01:08:24.189 --> 01:08:30.029
that you've got to go calculate it for your
own microscope and then you count the mitosis

01:08:30.029 --> 01:08:33.569
and usually what I do is I'll find the area
that looks most active like oh here's an area

01:08:33.569 --> 01:08:41.319
I've got at least two here so we can find
this area we can say okay one-two mitosis

01:08:41.319 --> 01:08:44.789
and then I'll move to an adjacent high power
field and I'll count there and then another

01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:48.460
field and I count three and a half fields
that way and I add that together and that's

01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:56.170
how I make my mitotic count and for details
about staging and these change from time to

01:08:56.170 --> 01:09:02.259
time you can look at the AJCC cancer staging
manual and we just had a change back in January

01:09:02.259 --> 01:09:07.869
from the seventh edition to the eighth edition
and a few things change and so I'm not gonna

01:09:07.869 --> 01:09:12.459
go really in depth into all the staging parameters
here because they do change and their significance

01:09:12.459 --> 01:09:16.540
clinically changes from time to time so whenever
you're watching this video you can go and

01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:20.829
look up the most recent version of the AJCC
and see what the current stage in practice

01:09:20.829 --> 01:09:25.900
is okay so again looking all the way here
we're now here down at the very bottom of

01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:31.339
the lesion and just like at the top we've
got big nests filled with atypical cells and

01:09:31.339 --> 01:09:39.290
look mitosis I got mitoses and atypia everywhere
even down the deep part of the lesion look

01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:44.210
this looks even uglier than the top of the
lesion it's like larger and more atypical

01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:47.900
than the cells even at the top and we're all
the way down in the deep dermis so this is

01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:54.630
a great example of abnormal maturation where
you have larger and even more atypical cells

01:09:54.630 --> 01:10:05.150
down to the deep aspect then you even had
at the top okay so nodular melanoma now one

01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:13.170
last thing I'll say is if you see something
that looks like a nodular melanoma

01:10:13.170 --> 01:10:17.050
like this kind of looks like one a little
bit not nearly as big as the last minutes

01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:22.739
it's a little nodule of melanoma here in the
dermis and it's got lots atypia and mitosis

01:10:22.739 --> 01:10:26.770
but look what it doesn’t have it doesn't
have any involvement of the epidermis it’s

01:10:26.770 --> 01:10:33.989
filling up the papillary dermis here and doesn’t
have any insight to component overtop of it

01:10:33.989 --> 01:10:38.260
so when you see that you have to think about
a metastatic lesion or a recurrent lesion

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:44.539
melanoma that has been biopsied or surgically
removed and then recurs in the scar or satellite

01:10:44.539 --> 01:10:49.769
lesions like little mini metastases that are
on their way to the regional lymph node we

01:10:49.769 --> 01:10:54.179
call those either satellites or in transit
metastasis or distant metastasis melanoma

01:10:54.179 --> 01:10:57.699
likes to metastasize to the skin it will go
to lymph nodes and other sites but it also

01:10:57.699 --> 01:11:02.579
will tend to show up in the skin elsewhere
on the body when melanoma either recurs locally

01:11:02.579 --> 01:11:08.469
or has a satellite or metastasizes to the
skin it will usually fill the dermis sometimes

01:11:08.469 --> 01:11:14.030
also the subcutis but will not usually involve
the epidermis so the lack of an in situ component

01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:18.749
is a useful clue that you might be dealing
with a metastatic melanoma okay and in this

01:11:18.749 --> 01:11:23.219
case this was actually a satellite leader
I think and in transit metastasis and the

01:11:23.219 --> 01:11:27.909
difference between that in transit Met and
satellite is based on how far from the lesion

01:11:27.909 --> 01:11:32.060
how big and you can again look in the AJCC
cancer manual they both indicate the same

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:37.280
thing melanoma is spreading from the primary
tumor site into or on its way towards the

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:40.239
lymph node and here there's a couple of nests
push right up in the papillary dermis but

01:11:40.239 --> 01:11:46.630
they're still not in the actual epidermis
okay and so that’s metastatic melanoma or

01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:50.770
a satellite lesion can both look like this
and recurrent melanoma if it's in the scar

01:11:50.770 --> 01:11:55.110
or right next to the scar of a previous melanoma
surgery and you see a nodule of melanoma pop

01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:58.519
up and then that's a recurrence the reason
it's important to know this pattern is number

01:11:58.519 --> 01:12:03.340
one if this is the first melanoma you're seeing
from the patient it's worth talking to the

01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:07.010
dermatologist and saying hey could this be
a metastatic lesion sometimes patients will

01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:10.869
have had a lesion biopsied a long time ago
and they forgot that about it and it's hard

01:12:10.869 --> 01:12:14.409
to believe but it’s true patient sometimes
forget that they used to that they had cancer

01:12:14.409 --> 01:12:18.571
at one point or forget that they had a biopsy
that maybe got thrown away and not sent to

01:12:18.571 --> 01:12:23.969
the lab I know that's shocking but I have
seen cases like that it's very tragic also

01:12:23.969 --> 01:12:27.510
sometimes a patient has a known history they
just haven't mentioned to their doctor and

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:32.020
sometimes we see something that looks like
a metastasis and after close full-body skin

01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:37.260
exam another area will be found that actually
was the primary melanoma or the primary melanoma

01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:41.079
may have been present but it regressed away
completely and only the metastasis is left

01:12:41.079 --> 01:12:45.449
or the patient picked at it until it you know
fell off their skin so they kind of treated

01:12:45.449 --> 01:12:49.800
it with their own fingernail picking and yet
still it developed a metastasis I’ve seen

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:53.670
all of those different scenarios so it’s
worth bringing up I've also seen times where

01:12:53.670 --> 01:12:59.170
we just have a big nodular melanoma where
either through the level of sectioning or

01:12:59.170 --> 01:13:04.840
due to a lot of ulceration the in-situ components
just not visualized but clinically after thorough

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:09.870
workup the most logical thing is that it's
a big primary melanoma even though we don't

01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:13.830
see an in-situ components so it's worth thinking
about when you see melanoma in the dermis

01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:18.840
without an in-situ component think about a
metastasis and think and discuss with the

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:25.110
surgeons or the dermatologists to see if that's
a possibility but just because it’s missing

01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:29.670
an in-situ component doesn’t necessarily
prove that it's a metastasis also metastatic

01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:34.320
melanoma and recurrent melanoma sometimes
can grow back up into the epidermis and mimic

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:38.260
a primary melanoma it can look like it has
an insight to component we call those epidermal

01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:43.300
tropic Mets so this one doesn’t have that
but this is a nice example of a pattern that

01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:47.209
you can see in metastatic melanoma and if
you don’t believe me that's melanoma on

01:13:47.209 --> 01:13:51.559
high-powered there's lots of atypia mitotic
activity and again there was a known melanoma

01:13:51.559 --> 01:13:56.980
nearby okay so remember that if there’s
not epidermal involvement think about the

01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:00.780
possibility of a met or recurrence the other
important reason to know about that is if

01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:05.980
it's a metastasis or a satellite or a recurrent
melanoma you don't measure the depth of it

01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:10.820
okay the depth is only measured on the primary
melanoma so it doesn't matter how deep that

01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:16.010
is that's not the prognostic impact is if
it's actually a satellite lesion or a metastasis

01:14:16.010 --> 01:14:20.290
that’s what matters then the primary tumor
depth doesn't really matter anymore once the

01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:24.360
melanoma started the spread or it doesn’t
matter much at least now the last thing I'll

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:29.110
show is when you see this this is what I often
see when I see a distant metastasis of melanoma

01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:34.969
I usually see normal skin up here and then
way down deep a big huge nodule of melanoma

01:14:34.969 --> 01:14:39.449
deep in the dermis sometimes in the sub cutis
a big nodule a ball of melanoma just sitting

01:14:39.449 --> 01:14:43.499
there in the dermis or subcutis that's the
pattern I usually see when I see metastatic

01:14:43.499 --> 01:14:48.900
melanoma in the skin okay either a nodule
in the dermis or subcutis often deeper down

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:54.219
and not even always close to the epidermis
so that's the pattern of metastatic melanoma

01:14:54.219 --> 01:14:58.920
so I think we’ve covered most of the main
features remember asymmetry pagetoid spread

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:06.170
confluent growth marked cytologic atypia abnormal
maturation or absence of maturation in the

01:15:06.170 --> 01:15:11.849
dermis mitotic activity in the dermis particularly
if it's abundant or atypical mitosis or deep

01:15:11.849 --> 01:15:16.249
mitosis deep in the deep aspect all of those
are features histologically that should make

01:15:16.249 --> 01:15:20.390
you consider the possibility of melanoma and
that should give you a good starting point

01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:24.249
and from there there's a lifetime worth of
learning to learn all the features like I

01:15:24.249 --> 01:15:28.380
said I'm still learning new stuff every day
about melanocytic lesions so I hope this at

01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:32.780
least gives you a good framework to start
with and I'll plan to make some more specific

01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:38.209
videos about different types of melanocytic
lesions both nevi and melanoma in the future
