8N0IZZpF8ts,1,00:00:04.020,00:00:05.990,hi I'm Jared gardener and today we are going to talk about the basic patterns
8N0IZZpF8ts,2,00:00:05.990,00:00:06.000,going to talk about the basic patterns
8N0IZZpF8ts,3,00:00:06.000,00:00:09.440,going to talk about the basic patterns of melanoma melanoma is a huge topic and
8N0IZZpF8ts,4,00:00:09.440,00:00:09.450,of melanoma melanoma is a huge topic and
8N0IZZpF8ts,5,00:00:09.450,00:00:11.930,of melanoma melanoma is a huge topic and there's so much the entire text books
8N0IZZpF8ts,6,00:00:11.930,00:00:11.940,there's so much the entire text books
8N0IZZpF8ts,7,00:00:11.940,00:00:13.430,there's so much the entire text books have been written about this so much to
8N0IZZpF8ts,8,00:00:13.430,00:00:13.440,have been written about this so much to
8N0IZZpF8ts,9,00:00:13.440,00:00:16.070,have been written about this so much to discuss but I want to go over some of
8N0IZZpF8ts,10,00:00:16.070,00:00:16.080,discuss but I want to go over some of
8N0IZZpF8ts,11,00:00:16.080,00:00:17.960,discuss but I want to go over some of the basic features that we see
8N0IZZpF8ts,12,00:00:17.960,00:00:17.970,the basic features that we see
8N0IZZpF8ts,13,00:00:17.970,00:00:20.750,the basic features that we see histologically that make us think about
8N0IZZpF8ts,14,00:00:20.750,00:00:20.760,histologically that make us think about
8N0IZZpF8ts,15,00:00:20.760,00:00:22.670,histologically that make us think about melanoma when we're evaluating Willie
8N0IZZpF8ts,16,00:00:22.670,00:00:22.680,melanoma when we're evaluating Willie
8N0IZZpF8ts,17,00:00:22.680,00:00:24.890,melanoma when we're evaluating Willie anesthetic lesions I have a video about
8N0IZZpF8ts,18,00:00:24.890,00:00:24.900,anesthetic lesions I have a video about
8N0IZZpF8ts,19,00:00:24.900,00:00:27.859,anesthetic lesions I have a video about the basics of benign Mullane acidic nev
8N0IZZpF8ts,20,00:00:27.859,00:00:27.869,the basics of benign Mullane acidic nev
8N0IZZpF8ts,21,00:00:27.869,00:00:29.320,the basics of benign Mullane acidic nev eye and if you haven't watched that yet
8N0IZZpF8ts,22,00:00:29.320,00:00:29.330,eye and if you haven't watched that yet
8N0IZZpF8ts,23,00:00:29.330,00:00:31.519,eye and if you haven't watched that yet I'll put a link in the top right corner
8N0IZZpF8ts,24,00:00:31.519,00:00:31.529,I'll put a link in the top right corner
8N0IZZpF8ts,25,00:00:31.529,00:00:33.260,I'll put a link in the top right corner of this video and also in the video
8N0IZZpF8ts,26,00:00:33.260,00:00:33.270,of this video and also in the video
8N0IZZpF8ts,27,00:00:33.270,00:00:34.729,of this video and also in the video description down below that might be
8N0IZZpF8ts,28,00:00:34.729,00:00:34.739,description down below that might be
8N0IZZpF8ts,29,00:00:34.739,00:00:37.490,description down below that might be useful because we're going to talk about
8N0IZZpF8ts,30,00:00:37.490,00:00:37.500,useful because we're going to talk about
8N0IZZpF8ts,31,00:00:37.500,00:00:41.000,useful because we're going to talk about some of the ways that melanoma violates
8N0IZZpF8ts,32,00:00:41.000,00:00:41.010,some of the ways that melanoma violates
8N0IZZpF8ts,33,00:00:41.010,00:00:43.850,some of the ways that melanoma violates the rules that we usually see in benign
8N0IZZpF8ts,34,00:00:43.850,00:00:43.860,the rules that we usually see in benign
8N0IZZpF8ts,35,00:00:43.860,00:00:46.880,the rules that we usually see in benign Nev I so a few of the things that we
8N0IZZpF8ts,36,00:00:46.880,00:00:46.890,Nev I so a few of the things that we
8N0IZZpF8ts,37,00:00:46.890,00:00:48.290,Nev I so a few of the things that we look at this is a little bit of an
8N0IZZpF8ts,38,00:00:48.290,00:00:48.300,look at this is a little bit of an
8N0IZZpF8ts,39,00:00:48.300,00:00:50.299,look at this is a little bit of an unusual melanoma to start with because
8N0IZZpF8ts,40,00:00:50.299,00:00:50.309,unusual melanoma to start with because
8N0IZZpF8ts,41,00:00:50.309,00:00:53.510,unusual melanoma to start with because of all the the keratin up top there's
8N0IZZpF8ts,42,00:00:53.510,00:00:53.520,of all the the keratin up top there's
8N0IZZpF8ts,43,00:00:53.520,00:00:57.770,of all the the keratin up top there's tons of dead keratin and scale what we
8N0IZZpF8ts,44,00:00:57.770,00:00:57.780,tons of dead keratin and scale what we
8N0IZZpF8ts,45,00:00:57.780,00:01:00.049,tons of dead keratin and scale what we call scale para keratosis with a lot of
8N0IZZpF8ts,46,00:01:00.049,00:01:00.059,call scale para keratosis with a lot of
8N0IZZpF8ts,47,00:01:00.059,00:01:02.119,call scale para keratosis with a lot of pigment in it up over top of the lesion
8N0IZZpF8ts,48,00:01:02.119,00:01:02.129,pigment in it up over top of the lesion
8N0IZZpF8ts,49,00:01:02.129,00:01:03.529,pigment in it up over top of the lesion there's also some crust than there to
8N0IZZpF8ts,50,00:01:03.529,00:01:03.539,there's also some crust than there to
8N0IZZpF8ts,51,00:01:03.539,00:01:06.530,there's also some crust than there to some serum so this was an inflamed and
8N0IZZpF8ts,52,00:01:06.530,00:01:06.540,some serum so this was an inflamed and
8N0IZZpF8ts,53,00:01:06.540,00:01:08.840,some serum so this was an inflamed and irritated melanoma but all of that crust
8N0IZZpF8ts,54,00:01:08.840,00:01:08.850,irritated melanoma but all of that crust
8N0IZZpF8ts,55,00:01:08.850,00:01:10.490,irritated melanoma but all of that crust actually made it look very much like an
8N0IZZpF8ts,56,00:01:10.490,00:01:10.500,actually made it look very much like an
8N0IZZpF8ts,57,00:01:10.500,00:01:12.649,actually made it look very much like an inflamed seborrheic keratosis to the
8N0IZZpF8ts,58,00:01:12.649,00:01:12.659,inflamed seborrheic keratosis to the
8N0IZZpF8ts,59,00:01:12.659,00:01:14.570,inflamed seborrheic keratosis to the dermatologist I remember distinctly
8N0IZZpF8ts,60,00:01:14.570,00:01:14.580,dermatologist I remember distinctly
8N0IZZpF8ts,61,00:01:14.580,00:01:16.609,dermatologist I remember distinctly actually when I called to report the
8N0IZZpF8ts,62,00:01:16.609,00:01:16.619,actually when I called to report the
8N0IZZpF8ts,63,00:01:16.619,00:01:18.140,actually when I called to report the diagnosis in this case and it was a long
8N0IZZpF8ts,64,00:01:18.140,00:01:18.150,diagnosis in this case and it was a long
8N0IZZpF8ts,65,00:01:18.150,00:01:20.060,diagnosis in this case and it was a long time ago but I remember they were really
8N0IZZpF8ts,66,00:01:20.060,00:01:20.070,time ago but I remember they were really
8N0IZZpF8ts,67,00:01:20.070,00:01:22.010,time ago but I remember they were really surprised because it really looked so
8N0IZZpF8ts,68,00:01:22.010,00:01:22.020,surprised because it really looked so
8N0IZZpF8ts,69,00:01:22.020,00:01:23.630,surprised because it really looked so much like a seborrheic keratosis and
8N0IZZpF8ts,70,00:01:23.630,00:01:23.640,much like a seborrheic keratosis and
8N0IZZpF8ts,71,00:01:23.640,00:01:25.700,much like a seborrheic keratosis and this is a good reminder of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,72,00:01:25.700,00:01:25.710,this is a good reminder of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,73,00:01:25.710,00:01:28.510,this is a good reminder of the importance of what we do as pathologists
8N0IZZpF8ts,74,00:01:28.510,00:01:28.520,importance of what we do as pathologists
8N0IZZpF8ts,75,00:01:28.520,00:01:30.890,importance of what we do as pathologists we have an important job still because
8N0IZZpF8ts,76,00:01:30.890,00:01:30.900,we have an important job still because
8N0IZZpF8ts,77,00:01:30.900,00:01:34.100,we have an important job still because sometimes even very good dermatologists
8N0IZZpF8ts,78,00:01:34.100,00:01:34.110,sometimes even very good dermatologists
8N0IZZpF8ts,79,00:01:34.110,00:01:35.749,sometimes even very good dermatologists or very good clinicians of other sorts
8N0IZZpF8ts,80,00:01:35.749,00:01:35.759,or very good clinicians of other sorts
8N0IZZpF8ts,81,00:01:35.759,00:01:37.969,or very good clinicians of other sorts have difficulty distinguishing between
8N0IZZpF8ts,82,00:01:37.969,00:01:37.979,have difficulty distinguishing between
8N0IZZpF8ts,83,00:01:37.979,00:01:41.090,have difficulty distinguishing between different entities clinically and we can
8N0IZZpF8ts,84,00:01:41.090,00:01:41.100,different entities clinically and we can
8N0IZZpF8ts,85,00:01:41.100,00:01:43.760,different entities clinically and we can often add value and help when we look at
8N0IZZpF8ts,86,00:01:43.760,00:01:43.770,often add value and help when we look at
8N0IZZpF8ts,87,00:01:43.770,00:01:45.920,often add value and help when we look at lesions microscopically and again this
8N0IZZpF8ts,88,00:01:45.920,00:01:45.930,lesions microscopically and again this
8N0IZZpF8ts,89,00:01:45.930,00:01:47.929,lesions microscopically and again this video is for educational purposes to
8N0IZZpF8ts,90,00:01:47.929,00:01:47.939,video is for educational purposes to
8N0IZZpF8ts,91,00:01:47.939,00:01:49.760,video is for educational purposes to help teach you like all of my videos are
8N0IZZpF8ts,92,00:01:49.760,00:01:49.770,help teach you like all of my videos are
8N0IZZpF8ts,93,00:01:49.770,00:01:52.039,help teach you like all of my videos are this is not a consultation this doesn't
8N0IZZpF8ts,94,00:01:52.039,00:01:52.049,this is not a consultation this doesn't
8N0IZZpF8ts,95,00:01:52.049,00:01:54.200,this is not a consultation this doesn't replace the need to get a consultation
8N0IZZpF8ts,96,00:01:54.200,00:01:54.210,replace the need to get a consultation
8N0IZZpF8ts,97,00:01:54.210,00:01:55.730,replace the need to get a consultation if you're not sure if it's a melanoma or
8N0IZZpF8ts,98,00:01:55.730,00:01:55.740,if you're not sure if it's a melanoma or
8N0IZZpF8ts,99,00:01:55.740,00:01:58.789,if you're not sure if it's a melanoma or not get expert help that a lot rides on
8N0IZZpF8ts,100,00:01:58.789,00:01:58.799,not get expert help that a lot rides on
8N0IZZpF8ts,101,00:01:58.799,00:02:01.850,not get expert help that a lot rides on a diagnosis of melanoma versus nevis and
8N0IZZpF8ts,102,00:02:01.850,00:02:01.860,a diagnosis of melanoma versus nevis and
8N0IZZpF8ts,103,00:02:01.860,00:02:03.440,a diagnosis of melanoma versus nevis and this is something that's very important
8N0IZZpF8ts,104,00:02:03.440,00:02:03.450,this is something that's very important
8N0IZZpF8ts,105,00:02:03.450,00:02:05.929,this is something that's very important and for patient care and legally of
8N0IZZpF8ts,106,00:02:05.929,00:02:05.939,and for patient care and legally of
8N0IZZpF8ts,107,00:02:05.939,00:02:09.410,and for patient care and legally of course so that's the the main point this
8N0IZZpF8ts,108,00:02:09.410,00:02:09.420,course so that's the the main point this
8N0IZZpF8ts,109,00:02:09.420,00:02:11.119,course so that's the the main point this is true again for all of my videos
8N0IZZpF8ts,110,00:02:11.119,00:02:11.129,is true again for all of my videos
8N0IZZpF8ts,111,00:02:11.129,00:02:11.840,is true again for all of my videos the
8N0IZZpF8ts,112,00:02:11.840,00:02:11.850,the
8N0IZZpF8ts,113,00:02:11.850,00:02:14.270,the these are for educational purposes and
8N0IZZpF8ts,114,00:02:14.270,00:02:14.280,these are for educational purposes and
8N0IZZpF8ts,115,00:02:14.280,00:02:17.420,these are for educational purposes and to help you learn about how we diagnose
8N0IZZpF8ts,116,00:02:17.420,00:02:17.430,to help you learn about how we diagnose
8N0IZZpF8ts,117,00:02:17.430,00:02:19.040,to help you learn about how we diagnose these things but of course you have to
8N0IZZpF8ts,118,00:02:19.040,00:02:19.050,these things but of course you have to
8N0IZZpF8ts,119,00:02:19.050,00:02:20.630,these things but of course you have to use your own medical judgment and get
8N0IZZpF8ts,120,00:02:20.630,00:02:20.640,use your own medical judgment and get
8N0IZZpF8ts,121,00:02:20.640,00:02:23.000,use your own medical judgment and get help when you need it so one of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,122,00:02:23.000,00:02:23.010,help when you need it so one of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,123,00:02:23.010,00:02:24.860,help when you need it so one of the first features I think that's useful
8N0IZZpF8ts,124,00:02:24.860,00:02:24.870,first features I think that's useful
8N0IZZpF8ts,125,00:02:24.870,00:02:27.050,first features I think that's useful when you look at melanomas start like
8N0IZZpF8ts,126,00:02:27.050,00:02:27.060,when you look at melanomas start like
8N0IZZpF8ts,127,00:02:27.060,00:02:28.790,when you look at melanomas start like just like for NIMH I start at low power
8N0IZZpF8ts,128,00:02:28.790,00:02:28.800,just like for NIMH I start at low power
8N0IZZpF8ts,129,00:02:28.800,00:02:31.880,just like for NIMH I start at low power ok look at the lesion at 2x or 4x
8N0IZZpF8ts,130,00:02:31.880,00:02:31.890,ok look at the lesion at 2x or 4x
8N0IZZpF8ts,131,00:02:31.890,00:02:33.800,ok look at the lesion at 2x or 4x whatever the lowest power objective is
8N0IZZpF8ts,132,00:02:33.800,00:02:33.810,whatever the lowest power objective is
8N0IZZpF8ts,133,00:02:33.810,00:02:36.590,whatever the lowest power objective is on your scope symmetry is a useful thing
8N0IZZpF8ts,134,00:02:36.590,00:02:36.600,on your scope symmetry is a useful thing
8N0IZZpF8ts,135,00:02:36.600,00:02:38.450,on your scope symmetry is a useful thing does the lesion if you draw a line down
8N0IZZpF8ts,136,00:02:38.450,00:02:38.460,does the lesion if you draw a line down
8N0IZZpF8ts,137,00:02:38.460,00:02:41.150,does the lesion if you draw a line down the middle of it from top to bottom if I
8N0IZZpF8ts,138,00:02:41.150,00:02:41.160,the middle of it from top to bottom if I
8N0IZZpF8ts,139,00:02:41.160,00:02:47.900,the middle of it from top to bottom if I go like this and make a line is the left
8N0IZZpF8ts,140,00:02:47.900,00:02:47.910,go like this and make a line is the left
8N0IZZpF8ts,141,00:02:47.910,00:02:50.060,go like this and make a line is the left side a mirror image of the right side
8N0IZZpF8ts,142,00:02:50.060,00:02:50.070,side a mirror image of the right side
8N0IZZpF8ts,143,00:02:50.070,00:02:51.500,side a mirror image of the right side well you might look at this and say yeah
8N0IZZpF8ts,144,00:02:51.500,00:02:51.510,well you might look at this and say yeah
8N0IZZpF8ts,145,00:02:51.510,00:02:53.000,well you might look at this and say yeah more or less it kind of looks the same
8N0IZZpF8ts,146,00:02:53.000,00:02:53.010,more or less it kind of looks the same
8N0IZZpF8ts,147,00:02:53.010,00:02:54.860,more or less it kind of looks the same on both sides but this is why it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,148,00:02:54.860,00:02:54.870,on both sides but this is why it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,149,00:02:54.870,00:02:56.930,on both sides but this is why it's important to not just look at the middle
8N0IZZpF8ts,150,00:02:56.930,00:02:56.940,important to not just look at the middle
8N0IZZpF8ts,151,00:02:56.940,00:02:58.670,important to not just look at the middle of the lesion in fact if I put down a
8N0IZZpF8ts,152,00:02:58.670,00:02:58.680,of the lesion in fact if I put down a
8N0IZZpF8ts,153,00:02:58.680,00:03:00.800,of the lesion in fact if I put down a slide and I see some obvious abnormality
8N0IZZpF8ts,154,00:03:00.800,00:03:00.810,slide and I see some obvious abnormality
8N0IZZpF8ts,155,00:03:00.810,00:03:03.050,slide and I see some obvious abnormality in the middle I oftentimes will go make
8N0IZZpF8ts,156,00:03:03.050,00:03:03.060,in the middle I oftentimes will go make
8N0IZZpF8ts,157,00:03:03.060,00:03:05.030,in the middle I oftentimes will go make myself look out at the edges first
8N0IZZpF8ts,158,00:03:05.030,00:03:05.040,myself look out at the edges first
8N0IZZpF8ts,159,00:03:05.040,00:03:06.710,myself look out at the edges first because I know that I'll get so fixated
8N0IZZpF8ts,160,00:03:06.710,00:03:06.720,because I know that I'll get so fixated
8N0IZZpF8ts,161,00:03:06.720,00:03:09.620,because I know that I'll get so fixated on this obviously abnormal finding that
8N0IZZpF8ts,162,00:03:09.620,00:03:09.630,on this obviously abnormal finding that
8N0IZZpF8ts,163,00:03:09.630,00:03:11.960,on this obviously abnormal finding that sometimes it's easy to forget looking at
8N0IZZpF8ts,164,00:03:11.960,00:03:11.970,sometimes it's easy to forget looking at
8N0IZZpF8ts,165,00:03:11.970,00:03:14.360,sometimes it's easy to forget looking at the periphery of the biopsy particularly
8N0IZZpF8ts,166,00:03:14.360,00:03:14.370,the periphery of the biopsy particularly
8N0IZZpF8ts,167,00:03:14.370,00:03:17.180,the periphery of the biopsy particularly on a broad shave biopsy and you know in
8N0IZZpF8ts,168,00:03:17.180,00:03:17.190,on a broad shave biopsy and you know in
8N0IZZpF8ts,169,00:03:17.190,00:03:18.560,on a broad shave biopsy and you know in the case where you have a basal cell or
8N0IZZpF8ts,170,00:03:18.560,00:03:18.570,the case where you have a basal cell or
8N0IZZpF8ts,171,00:03:18.570,00:03:20.900,the case where you have a basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma say we don't
8N0IZZpF8ts,172,00:03:20.900,00:03:20.910,squamous cell carcinoma say we don't
8N0IZZpF8ts,173,00:03:20.910,00:03:22.100,squamous cell carcinoma say we don't have that here but if you have one of
8N0IZZpF8ts,174,00:03:22.100,00:03:22.110,have that here but if you have one of
8N0IZZpF8ts,175,00:03:22.110,00:03:23.600,have that here but if you have one of those sometimes if you don't look at the
8N0IZZpF8ts,176,00:03:23.600,00:03:23.610,those sometimes if you don't look at the
8N0IZZpF8ts,177,00:03:23.610,00:03:24.770,those sometimes if you don't look at the edge you might miss there may be a
8N0IZZpF8ts,178,00:03:24.770,00:03:24.780,edge you might miss there may be a
8N0IZZpF8ts,179,00:03:24.780,00:03:26.270,edge you might miss there may be a little melanoma out to the side I've
8N0IZZpF8ts,180,00:03:26.270,00:03:26.280,little melanoma out to the side I've
8N0IZZpF8ts,181,00:03:26.280,00:03:28.460,little melanoma out to the side I've seen that happen a few times so I try to
8N0IZZpF8ts,182,00:03:28.460,00:03:28.470,seen that happen a few times so I try to
8N0IZZpF8ts,183,00:03:28.470,00:03:30.740,seen that happen a few times so I try to always make myself look at the periphery
8N0IZZpF8ts,184,00:03:30.740,00:03:30.750,always make myself look at the periphery
8N0IZZpF8ts,185,00:03:30.750,00:03:32.840,always make myself look at the periphery the normal looking stuff away from the
8N0IZZpF8ts,186,00:03:32.840,00:03:32.850,the normal looking stuff away from the
8N0IZZpF8ts,187,00:03:32.850,00:03:35.420,the normal looking stuff away from the main tumor in the middle and then when
8N0IZZpF8ts,188,00:03:35.420,00:03:35.430,main tumor in the middle and then when
8N0IZZpF8ts,189,00:03:35.430,00:03:36.830,main tumor in the middle and then when I've determined that that's all clear
8N0IZZpF8ts,190,00:03:36.830,00:03:36.840,I've determined that that's all clear
8N0IZZpF8ts,191,00:03:36.840,00:03:38.840,I've determined that that's all clear come back to the tumor that way I don't
8N0IZZpF8ts,192,00:03:38.840,00:03:38.850,come back to the tumor that way I don't
8N0IZZpF8ts,193,00:03:38.850,00:03:40.610,come back to the tumor that way I don't get too fixated on the tumor and forget
8N0IZZpF8ts,194,00:03:40.610,00:03:40.620,get too fixated on the tumor and forget
8N0IZZpF8ts,195,00:03:40.620,00:03:42.620,get too fixated on the tumor and forget to check those edges okay so just a
8N0IZZpF8ts,196,00:03:42.620,00:03:42.630,to check those edges okay so just a
8N0IZZpF8ts,197,00:03:42.630,00:03:44.780,to check those edges okay so just a little a general tip for during path but
8N0IZZpF8ts,198,00:03:44.780,00:03:44.790,little a general tip for during path but
8N0IZZpF8ts,199,00:03:44.790,00:03:46.760,little a general tip for during path but look as we go out here to the side this
8N0IZZpF8ts,200,00:03:46.760,00:03:46.770,look as we go out here to the side this
8N0IZZpF8ts,201,00:03:46.770,00:03:48.200,look as we go out here to the side this may look like normal skin at first
8N0IZZpF8ts,202,00:03:48.200,00:03:48.210,may look like normal skin at first
8N0IZZpF8ts,203,00:03:48.210,00:03:49.550,may look like normal skin at first glance compared to what we were just
8N0IZZpF8ts,204,00:03:49.550,00:03:49.560,glance compared to what we were just
8N0IZZpF8ts,205,00:03:49.560,00:03:53.450,glance compared to what we were just looking at but look closer there are
8N0IZZpF8ts,206,00:03:53.450,00:03:53.460,looking at but look closer there are
8N0IZZpF8ts,207,00:03:53.460,00:03:56.030,looking at but look closer there are actually melanocytes in here increased
8N0IZZpF8ts,208,00:03:56.030,00:03:56.040,actually melanocytes in here increased
8N0IZZpF8ts,209,00:03:56.040,00:03:59.980,actually melanocytes in here increased melanocytes and you can see they're
8N0IZZpF8ts,210,00:03:59.980,00:03:59.990,melanocytes and you can see they're
8N0IZZpF8ts,211,00:03:59.990,00:04:02.480,melanocytes and you can see they're grayish brown they have this kind of
8N0IZZpF8ts,212,00:04:02.480,00:04:02.490,grayish brown they have this kind of
8N0IZZpF8ts,213,00:04:02.490,00:04:04.490,grayish brown they have this kind of dirty grayish cytoplasm which we often
8N0IZZpF8ts,214,00:04:04.490,00:04:04.500,dirty grayish cytoplasm which we often
8N0IZZpF8ts,215,00:04:04.500,00:04:06.700,dirty grayish cytoplasm which we often see in melanomas but sometimes in neve i
8N0IZZpF8ts,216,00:04:06.700,00:04:06.710,see in melanomas but sometimes in neve i
8N0IZZpF8ts,217,00:04:06.710,00:04:09.680,see in melanomas but sometimes in neve i there's a mitosis in here there's really
8N0IZZpF8ts,218,00:04:09.680,00:04:09.690,there's a mitosis in here there's really
8N0IZZpF8ts,219,00:04:09.690,00:04:13.970,there's a mitosis in here there's really marked nuclear atypia a lot of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,220,00:04:13.970,00:04:13.980,marked nuclear atypia a lot of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,221,00:04:13.980,00:04:15.010,marked nuclear atypia a lot of the features we're going to talk about
8N0IZZpF8ts,222,00:04:15.010,00:04:15.020,features we're going to talk about
8N0IZZpF8ts,223,00:04:15.020,00:04:17.630,features we're going to talk about throughout this video but this is
8N0IZZpF8ts,224,00:04:17.630,00:04:17.640,throughout this video but this is
8N0IZZpF8ts,225,00:04:17.640,00:04:21.170,throughout this video but this is melanoma out here so when you compare or
8N0IZZpF8ts,226,00:04:21.170,00:04:21.180,melanoma out here so when you compare or
8N0IZZpF8ts,227,00:04:21.180,00:04:23.240,melanoma out here so when you compare or contrast that rather this doesn't look
8N0IZZpF8ts,228,00:04:23.240,00:04:23.250,contrast that rather this doesn't look
8N0IZZpF8ts,229,00:04:23.250,00:04:25.219,contrast that rather this doesn't look like much maybe but here we have one
8N0IZZpF8ts,230,00:04:25.219,00:04:25.229,like much maybe but here we have one
8N0IZZpF8ts,231,00:04:25.229,00:04:25.640,like much maybe but here we have one side of
8N0IZZpF8ts,232,00:04:25.640,00:04:25.650,side of
8N0IZZpF8ts,233,00:04:25.650,00:04:27.800,side of lesion that looks very different from
8N0IZZpF8ts,234,00:04:27.800,00:04:27.810,lesion that looks very different from
8N0IZZpF8ts,235,00:04:27.810,00:04:29.200,lesion that looks very different from the other side of the lesion so
8N0IZZpF8ts,236,00:04:29.200,00:04:29.210,the other side of the lesion so
8N0IZZpF8ts,237,00:04:29.210,00:04:31.670,the other side of the lesion so asymmetrical lesions doesn't mean that
8N0IZZpF8ts,238,00:04:31.670,00:04:31.680,asymmetrical lesions doesn't mean that
8N0IZZpF8ts,239,00:04:31.680,00:04:33.439,asymmetrical lesions doesn't mean that they are always melanoma but it's a
8N0IZZpF8ts,240,00:04:33.439,00:04:33.449,they are always melanoma but it's a
8N0IZZpF8ts,241,00:04:33.449,00:04:35.060,they are always melanoma but it's a warning sign and you should go look
8N0IZZpF8ts,242,00:04:35.060,00:04:35.070,warning sign and you should go look
8N0IZZpF8ts,243,00:04:35.070,00:04:37.189,warning sign and you should go look closer and think about the possibility
8N0IZZpF8ts,244,00:04:37.189,00:04:37.199,closer and think about the possibility
8N0IZZpF8ts,245,00:04:37.199,00:04:39.290,closer and think about the possibility of melanoma and that's going to be true
8N0IZZpF8ts,246,00:04:39.290,00:04:39.300,of melanoma and that's going to be true
8N0IZZpF8ts,247,00:04:39.300,00:04:40.879,of melanoma and that's going to be true for all of the the points that we
8N0IZZpF8ts,248,00:04:40.879,00:04:40.889,for all of the the points that we
8N0IZZpF8ts,249,00:04:40.889,00:04:42.409,for all of the the points that we discuss in this video I'm going to talk
8N0IZZpF8ts,250,00:04:42.409,00:04:42.419,discuss in this video I'm going to talk
8N0IZZpF8ts,251,00:04:42.419,00:04:45.080,discuss in this video I'm going to talk to you about a symmetry about Paget I'd
8N0IZZpF8ts,252,00:04:45.080,00:04:45.090,to you about a symmetry about Paget I'd
8N0IZZpF8ts,253,00:04:45.090,00:04:48.610,to you about a symmetry about Paget I'd spread confluent growth abnormal
8N0IZZpF8ts,254,00:04:48.610,00:04:48.620,spread confluent growth abnormal
8N0IZZpF8ts,255,00:04:48.620,00:04:50.960,spread confluent growth abnormal maturation or loss of maturation in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,256,00:04:50.960,00:04:50.970,maturation or loss of maturation in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,257,00:04:50.970,00:04:53.300,maturation or loss of maturation in the dermis mitotic activity in the dermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,258,00:04:53.300,00:04:53.310,dermis mitotic activity in the dermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,259,00:04:53.310,00:04:55.550,dermis mitotic activity in the dermis and nuclear atypia in the melanocytes
8N0IZZpF8ts,260,00:04:55.550,00:04:55.560,and nuclear atypia in the melanocytes
8N0IZZpF8ts,261,00:04:55.560,00:04:57.800,and nuclear atypia in the melanocytes those are kind of the main features all
8N0IZZpF8ts,262,00:04:57.800,00:04:57.810,those are kind of the main features all
8N0IZZpF8ts,263,00:04:57.810,00:05:00.920,those are kind of the main features all of those together that I think of for
8N0IZZpF8ts,264,00:05:00.920,00:05:00.930,of those together that I think of for
8N0IZZpF8ts,265,00:05:00.930,00:05:03.020,of those together that I think of for melanoma the problem is is that none of
8N0IZZpF8ts,266,00:05:03.020,00:05:03.030,melanoma the problem is is that none of
8N0IZZpF8ts,267,00:05:03.030,00:05:05.600,melanoma the problem is is that none of those features is perfect okay I can I
8N0IZZpF8ts,268,00:05:05.600,00:05:05.610,those features is perfect okay I can I
8N0IZZpF8ts,269,00:05:05.610,00:05:08.779,those features is perfect okay I can I can point to a benign nevis that has one
8N0IZZpF8ts,270,00:05:08.779,00:05:08.789,can point to a benign nevis that has one
8N0IZZpF8ts,271,00:05:08.789,00:05:10.189,can point to a benign nevis that has one of the I mean I've seen all of those
8N0IZZpF8ts,272,00:05:10.189,00:05:10.199,of the I mean I've seen all of those
8N0IZZpF8ts,273,00:05:10.199,00:05:12.439,of the I mean I've seen all of those different features usually by themselves
8N0IZZpF8ts,274,00:05:12.439,00:05:12.449,different features usually by themselves
8N0IZZpF8ts,275,00:05:12.449,00:05:14.450,different features usually by themselves in need I before I've seen Nev I that
8N0IZZpF8ts,276,00:05:14.450,00:05:14.460,in need I before I've seen Nev I that
8N0IZZpF8ts,277,00:05:14.460,00:05:16.070,in need I before I've seen Nev I that are asymmetric I've seen me by that have
8N0IZZpF8ts,278,00:05:16.070,00:05:16.080,are asymmetric I've seen me by that have
8N0IZZpF8ts,279,00:05:16.080,00:05:18.200,are asymmetric I've seen me by that have mitosis or that have atypia or that have
8N0IZZpF8ts,280,00:05:18.200,00:05:18.210,mitosis or that have atypia or that have
8N0IZZpF8ts,281,00:05:18.210,00:05:20.390,mitosis or that have atypia or that have apparently abnormal maturation and the
8N0IZZpF8ts,282,00:05:20.390,00:05:20.400,apparently abnormal maturation and the
8N0IZZpF8ts,283,00:05:20.400,00:05:22.219,apparently abnormal maturation and the dermis okay I've even seen patch Toit
8N0IZZpF8ts,284,00:05:22.219,00:05:22.229,dermis okay I've even seen patch Toit
8N0IZZpF8ts,285,00:05:22.229,00:05:24.409,dermis okay I've even seen patch Toit spread and Nev I so that's the problem
8N0IZZpF8ts,286,00:05:24.409,00:05:24.419,spread and Nev I so that's the problem
8N0IZZpF8ts,287,00:05:24.419,00:05:25.999,spread and Nev I so that's the problem and that's what makes derm path and
8N0IZZpF8ts,288,00:05:25.999,00:05:26.009,and that's what makes derm path and
8N0IZZpF8ts,289,00:05:26.009,00:05:27.290,and that's what makes derm path and particularly Mele an acidic term how
8N0IZZpF8ts,290,00:05:27.290,00:05:27.300,particularly Mele an acidic term how
8N0IZZpF8ts,291,00:05:27.300,00:05:30.110,particularly Mele an acidic term how hard is that there are not easy rules or
8N0IZZpF8ts,292,00:05:30.110,00:05:30.120,hard is that there are not easy rules or
8N0IZZpF8ts,293,00:05:30.120,00:05:32.570,hard is that there are not easy rules or firm hard and fast rules that you can
8N0IZZpF8ts,294,00:05:32.570,00:05:32.580,firm hard and fast rules that you can
8N0IZZpF8ts,295,00:05:32.580,00:05:34.909,firm hard and fast rules that you can use all of the rules by putting air
8N0IZZpF8ts,296,00:05:34.909,00:05:34.919,use all of the rules by putting air
8N0IZZpF8ts,297,00:05:34.919,00:05:36.320,use all of the rules by putting air quotes you can't see it but I'm putting
8N0IZZpF8ts,298,00:05:36.320,00:05:36.330,quotes you can't see it but I'm putting
8N0IZZpF8ts,299,00:05:36.330,00:05:38.210,quotes you can't see it but I'm putting air quotes around the word rules all of
8N0IZZpF8ts,300,00:05:38.210,00:05:38.220,air quotes around the word rules all of
8N0IZZpF8ts,301,00:05:38.220,00:05:41.300,air quotes around the word rules all of the the rules can be broken okay and you
8N0IZZpF8ts,302,00:05:41.300,00:05:41.310,the the rules can be broken okay and you
8N0IZZpF8ts,303,00:05:41.310,00:05:43.100,the the rules can be broken okay and you can also have melanomas that don't have
8N0IZZpF8ts,304,00:05:43.100,00:05:43.110,can also have melanomas that don't have
8N0IZZpF8ts,305,00:05:43.110,00:05:45.170,can also have melanomas that don't have some of the features that we're going to
8N0IZZpF8ts,306,00:05:45.170,00:05:45.180,some of the features that we're going to
8N0IZZpF8ts,307,00:05:45.180,00:05:46.550,some of the features that we're going to discuss today usually they'll have at
8N0IZZpF8ts,308,00:05:46.550,00:05:46.560,discuss today usually they'll have at
8N0IZZpF8ts,309,00:05:46.560,00:05:48.860,discuss today usually they'll have at least one or multiple of those features
8N0IZZpF8ts,310,00:05:48.860,00:05:48.870,least one or multiple of those features
8N0IZZpF8ts,311,00:05:48.870,00:05:50.540,least one or multiple of those features but not always they're not some
8N0IZZpF8ts,312,00:05:50.540,00:05:50.550,but not always they're not some
8N0IZZpF8ts,313,00:05:50.550,00:05:53.000,but not always they're not some melanomas look symmetric symmetrical and
8N0IZZpF8ts,314,00:05:53.000,00:05:53.010,melanomas look symmetric symmetrical and
8N0IZZpF8ts,315,00:05:53.010,00:05:55.310,melanomas look symmetric symmetrical and are not asymmetric okay so I think it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,316,00:05:55.310,00:05:55.320,are not asymmetric okay so I think it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,317,00:05:55.320,00:05:56.629,are not asymmetric okay so I think it's important to just remember that these
8N0IZZpF8ts,318,00:05:56.629,00:05:56.639,important to just remember that these
8N0IZZpF8ts,319,00:05:56.639,00:05:58.580,important to just remember that these are general guidelines and when you see
8N0IZZpF8ts,320,00:05:58.580,00:05:58.590,are general guidelines and when you see
8N0IZZpF8ts,321,00:05:58.590,00:05:59.689,are general guidelines and when you see these things stop and think about
8N0IZZpF8ts,322,00:05:59.689,00:05:59.699,these things stop and think about
8N0IZZpF8ts,323,00:05:59.699,00:06:01.870,these things stop and think about melanoma but you have to put the entire
8N0IZZpF8ts,324,00:06:01.870,00:06:01.880,melanoma but you have to put the entire
8N0IZZpF8ts,325,00:06:01.880,00:06:03.860,melanoma but you have to put the entire microscopic picture together all the
8N0IZZpF8ts,326,00:06:03.860,00:06:03.870,microscopic picture together all the
8N0IZZpF8ts,327,00:06:03.870,00:06:05.390,microscopic picture together all the different data points and you have to
8N0IZZpF8ts,328,00:06:05.390,00:06:05.400,different data points and you have to
8N0IZZpF8ts,329,00:06:05.400,00:06:07.010,different data points and you have to put together the clinical scenario and
8N0IZZpF8ts,330,00:06:07.010,00:06:07.020,put together the clinical scenario and
8N0IZZpF8ts,331,00:06:07.020,00:06:08.689,put together the clinical scenario and make sure it makes sense is it a
8N0IZZpF8ts,332,00:06:08.689,00:06:08.699,make sure it makes sense is it a
8N0IZZpF8ts,333,00:06:08.699,00:06:11.629,make sure it makes sense is it a one-year-old baby then it's probably not
8N0IZZpF8ts,334,00:06:11.629,00:06:11.639,one-year-old baby then it's probably not
8N0IZZpF8ts,335,00:06:11.639,00:06:13.310,one-year-old baby then it's probably not a melanoma it's not that little babies
8N0IZZpF8ts,336,00:06:13.310,00:06:13.320,a melanoma it's not that little babies
8N0IZZpF8ts,337,00:06:13.320,00:06:15.710,a melanoma it's not that little babies can't get melanomas they are extremely
8N0IZZpF8ts,338,00:06:15.710,00:06:15.720,can't get melanomas they are extremely
8N0IZZpF8ts,339,00:06:15.720,00:06:18.409,can't get melanomas they are extremely rare but it has been reported okay
8N0IZZpF8ts,340,00:06:18.409,00:06:18.419,rare but it has been reported okay
8N0IZZpF8ts,341,00:06:18.419,00:06:20.870,rare but it has been reported okay is it a ninety year old person and you
8N0IZZpF8ts,342,00:06:20.870,00:06:20.880,is it a ninety year old person and you
8N0IZZpF8ts,343,00:06:20.880,00:06:22.490,is it a ninety year old person and you think that this is a really large nevis
8N0IZZpF8ts,344,00:06:22.490,00:06:22.500,think that this is a really large nevis
8N0IZZpF8ts,345,00:06:22.500,00:06:24.260,think that this is a really large nevis on their scalp and they're really sun
8N0IZZpF8ts,346,00:06:24.260,00:06:24.270,on their scalp and they're really sun
8N0IZZpF8ts,347,00:06:24.270,00:06:26.600,on their scalp and they're really sun damaged well could it be yep possibly
8N0IZZpF8ts,348,00:06:26.600,00:06:26.610,damaged well could it be yep possibly
8N0IZZpF8ts,349,00:06:26.610,00:06:28.339,damaged well could it be yep possibly but there's a really good chance that
8N0IZZpF8ts,350,00:06:28.339,00:06:28.349,but there's a really good chance that
8N0IZZpF8ts,351,00:06:28.349,00:06:29.810,but there's a really good chance that you're dealing with the melanoma instead
8N0IZZpF8ts,352,00:06:29.810,00:06:29.820,you're dealing with the melanoma instead
8N0IZZpF8ts,353,00:06:29.820,00:06:31.760,you're dealing with the melanoma instead so you have to use the clinical scenario
8N0IZZpF8ts,354,00:06:31.760,00:06:31.770,so you have to use the clinical scenario
8N0IZZpF8ts,355,00:06:31.770,00:06:33.680,so you have to use the clinical scenario and make sure that the diagnosis that
8N0IZZpF8ts,356,00:06:33.680,00:06:33.690,and make sure that the diagnosis that
8N0IZZpF8ts,357,00:06:33.690,00:06:35.510,and make sure that the diagnosis that you want to make makes sense and that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,358,00:06:35.510,00:06:35.520,you want to make makes sense and that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,359,00:06:35.520,00:06:37.190,you want to make makes sense and that's true I think in all of pathology
8N0IZZpF8ts,360,00:06:37.190,00:06:37.200,true I think in all of pathology
8N0IZZpF8ts,361,00:06:37.200,00:06:39.469,true I think in all of pathology particularly in Durham path particularly
8N0IZZpF8ts,362,00:06:39.469,00:06:39.479,particularly in Durham path particularly
8N0IZZpF8ts,363,00:06:39.479,00:06:40.879,particularly in Durham path particularly in Malaya
8N0IZZpF8ts,364,00:06:40.879,00:06:40.889,in Malaya
8N0IZZpF8ts,365,00:06:40.889,00:06:43.369,in Malaya okay so that with all those caveats
8N0IZZpF8ts,366,00:06:43.369,00:06:43.379,okay so that with all those caveats
8N0IZZpF8ts,367,00:06:43.379,00:06:45.529,okay so that with all those caveats let's go back to the features so we
8N0IZZpF8ts,368,00:06:45.529,00:06:45.539,let's go back to the features so we
8N0IZZpF8ts,369,00:06:45.539,00:06:47.179,let's go back to the features so we talked about asymmetry where one side of
8N0IZZpF8ts,370,00:06:47.179,00:06:47.189,talked about asymmetry where one side of
8N0IZZpF8ts,371,00:06:47.189,00:06:49.040,talked about asymmetry where one side of the lesion looks very different from the
8N0IZZpF8ts,372,00:06:49.040,00:06:49.050,the lesion looks very different from the
8N0IZZpF8ts,373,00:06:49.050,00:06:50.719,the lesion looks very different from the other side of the lesion and I just
8N0IZZpF8ts,374,00:06:50.719,00:06:50.729,other side of the lesion and I just
8N0IZZpF8ts,375,00:06:50.729,00:06:52.850,other side of the lesion and I just recently learned I'm reading a textbook
8N0IZZpF8ts,376,00:06:52.850,00:06:52.860,recently learned I'm reading a textbook
8N0IZZpF8ts,377,00:06:52.860,00:06:54.739,recently learned I'm reading a textbook right now about Niva and melanoma and
8N0IZZpF8ts,378,00:06:54.739,00:06:54.749,right now about Niva and melanoma and
8N0IZZpF8ts,379,00:06:54.749,00:06:56.330,right now about Niva and melanoma and it's written by Guido Massey and Phila
8N0IZZpF8ts,380,00:06:56.330,00:06:56.340,it's written by Guido Massey and Phila
8N0IZZpF8ts,381,00:06:56.340,00:06:58.999,it's written by Guido Massey and Phila bla and it's a wonderful book I'm not
8N0IZZpF8ts,382,00:06:58.999,00:06:59.009,bla and it's a wonderful book I'm not
8N0IZZpF8ts,383,00:06:59.009,00:07:00.379,bla and it's a wonderful book I'm not paid to say this I just think it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,384,00:07:00.379,00:07:00.389,paid to say this I just think it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,385,00:07:00.389,00:07:02.119,paid to say this I just think it's really great and one thing that they
8N0IZZpF8ts,386,00:07:02.119,00:07:02.129,really great and one thing that they
8N0IZZpF8ts,387,00:07:02.129,00:07:04.459,really great and one thing that they pointed out is that asymmetry of pigment
8N0IZZpF8ts,388,00:07:04.459,00:07:04.469,pointed out is that asymmetry of pigment
8N0IZZpF8ts,389,00:07:04.469,00:07:06.260,pointed out is that asymmetry of pigment when you have a lot of pigment on one
8N0IZZpF8ts,390,00:07:06.260,00:07:06.270,when you have a lot of pigment on one
8N0IZZpF8ts,391,00:07:06.270,00:07:07.909,when you have a lot of pigment on one half of the lesion and not as much
8N0IZZpF8ts,392,00:07:07.909,00:07:07.919,half of the lesion and not as much
8N0IZZpF8ts,393,00:07:07.919,00:07:09.140,half of the lesion and not as much pigment on the other half of lesion that
8N0IZZpF8ts,394,00:07:09.140,00:07:09.150,pigment on the other half of lesion that
8N0IZZpF8ts,395,00:07:09.150,00:07:11.239,pigment on the other half of lesion that can also be a sign to make you wonder
8N0IZZpF8ts,396,00:07:11.239,00:07:11.249,can also be a sign to make you wonder
8N0IZZpF8ts,397,00:07:11.249,00:07:13.070,can also be a sign to make you wonder about the possibility of melanoma so
8N0IZZpF8ts,398,00:07:13.070,00:07:13.080,about the possibility of melanoma so
8N0IZZpF8ts,399,00:07:13.080,00:07:14.089,about the possibility of melanoma so that's something I had not learned
8N0IZZpF8ts,400,00:07:14.089,00:07:14.099,that's something I had not learned
8N0IZZpF8ts,401,00:07:14.099,00:07:16.010,that's something I had not learned before and I'm still learning new things
8N0IZZpF8ts,402,00:07:16.010,00:07:16.020,before and I'm still learning new things
8N0IZZpF8ts,403,00:07:16.020,00:07:17.600,before and I'm still learning new things about mullion acidic lesions all the
8N0IZZpF8ts,404,00:07:17.600,00:07:17.610,about mullion acidic lesions all the
8N0IZZpF8ts,405,00:07:17.610,00:07:20.420,about mullion acidic lesions all the time all right so enough you're probably
8N0IZZpF8ts,406,00:07:20.420,00:07:20.430,time all right so enough you're probably
8N0IZZpF8ts,407,00:07:20.430,00:07:21.890,time all right so enough you're probably saying enough of this low power stuff
8N0IZZpF8ts,408,00:07:21.890,00:07:21.900,saying enough of this low power stuff
8N0IZZpF8ts,409,00:07:21.900,00:07:23.600,saying enough of this low power stuff show me high power well you don't really
8N0IZZpF8ts,410,00:07:23.600,00:07:23.610,show me high power well you don't really
8N0IZZpF8ts,411,00:07:23.610,00:07:25.640,show me high power well you don't really need high power in this case to see that
8N0IZZpF8ts,412,00:07:25.640,00:07:25.650,need high power in this case to see that
8N0IZZpF8ts,413,00:07:25.650,00:07:27.740,need high power in this case to see that there is unbelievable amount of Paget
8N0IZZpF8ts,414,00:07:27.740,00:07:27.750,there is unbelievable amount of Paget
8N0IZZpF8ts,415,00:07:27.750,00:07:29.779,there is unbelievable amount of Paget I'd spread okay Paget's would spread
8N0IZZpF8ts,416,00:07:29.779,00:07:29.789,I'd spread okay Paget's would spread
8N0IZZpF8ts,417,00:07:29.789,00:07:32.329,I'd spread okay Paget's would spread refers to the scattering of melanocytes

8N0IZZpF8ts,435,00:07:49.379,00:07:51.499,normal skin histology I've got a video on that too and you can check that out
8N0IZZpF8ts,436,00:07:51.499,00:07:51.509,on that too and you can check that out
8N0IZZpF8ts,437,00:07:51.509,00:07:54.079,on that too and you can check that out I'll put a link in the upper right-hand

8N0IZZpF8ts,439,00:07:54.089,00:07:59.089,I'll put a link in the upper right-hand corner of this video as well okay and so
8N0IZZpF8ts,440,00:07:59.089,00:07:59.099,corner of this video as well okay and so
8N0IZZpF8ts,441,00:07:59.099,00:08:00.350,corner of this video as well okay and so that's where I'm only on sites normally

8N0IZZpF8ts,461,00:08:18.870,00:08:21.499,spinous layer or even up to the granular layer or beyond we have to think about
8N0IZZpF8ts,462,00:08:21.499,00:08:21.509,layer or beyond we have to think about
8N0IZZpF8ts,463,00:08:21.509,00:08:23.869,layer or beyond we have to think about melanoma okay and we say Padgett wait
8N0IZZpF8ts,464,00:08:23.869,00:08:23.879,melanoma okay and we say Padgett wait
8N0IZZpF8ts,465,00:08:23.879,00:08:25.279,melanoma okay and we say Padgett wait because this is a similar pattern that

8N0IZZpF8ts,481,00:08:41.039,00:08:43.100,Paget or spreads squamous cell carcinoma in situ is actually the most common

8N0IZZpF8ts,485,00:08:45.779,00:08:47.780,tumor that I see in my practice with Paget widespread I see Paget own spread
8N0IZZpF8ts,486,00:08:47.780,00:08:47.790,Paget widespread I see Paget own spread
8N0IZZpF8ts,487,00:08:47.790,00:08:49.759,Paget widespread I see Paget own spread in squamous cell carcinoma almost
8N0IZZpF8ts,488,00:08:49.759,00:08:49.769,in squamous cell carcinoma almost
8N0IZZpF8ts,489,00:08:49.769,00:08:52.040,in squamous cell carcinoma almost everyday and of course I see melanomas
8N0IZZpF8ts,490,00:08:52.040,00:08:52.050,everyday and of course I see melanomas
8N0IZZpF8ts,491,00:08:52.050,00:08:53.340,everyday and of course I see melanomas almost every day as well
8N0IZZpF8ts,492,00:08:53.340,00:08:53.350,almost every day as well
8N0IZZpF8ts,493,00:08:53.350,00:08:55.590,almost every day as well but it's certainly a lot more frequent I
8N0IZZpF8ts,494,00:08:55.590,00:08:55.600,but it's certainly a lot more frequent I
8N0IZZpF8ts,495,00:08:55.600,00:08:58.470,but it's certainly a lot more frequent I think the cease claims and just keep

8N0IZZpF8ts,497,00:08:58.480,00:08:59.790,think the cease claims and just keep that in mind that not everything with

8N0IZZpF8ts,503,00:09:04.720,00:09:05.880,melanoma okay it's not necessarily even Malayan acidic there are other things

8N0IZZpF8ts,505,00:09:05.890,00:09:07.590,Malayan acidic there are other things that have Padgett roid spread but when

8N0IZZpF8ts,545,00:09:44.200,00:09:46.020,in here and we're way out at the edge the periphery of the lesion so that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,546,00:09:46.020,00:09:46.030,the periphery of the lesion so that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,547,00:09:46.030,00:09:48.180,the periphery of the lesion so that's also a strong warning sign okay so if
8N0IZZpF8ts,548,00:09:48.180,00:09:48.190,also a strong warning sign okay so if
8N0IZZpF8ts,549,00:09:48.190,00:09:49.980,also a strong warning sign okay so if you think it looks perfect for a Nevis
8N0IZZpF8ts,550,00:09:49.980,00:09:49.990,you think it looks perfect for a Nevis
8N0IZZpF8ts,551,00:09:49.990,00:09:51.600,you think it looks perfect for a Nevis and there may be one or two patches to

8N0IZZpF8ts,561,00:10:01.660,00:10:03.420,Padgett woods spread and so do spits Nev I sometimes in a readme buy so again
8N0IZZpF8ts,562,00:10:03.420,00:10:03.430,I sometimes in a readme buy so again
8N0IZZpF8ts,563,00:10:03.430,00:10:05.040,I sometimes in a readme buy so again there are lots of exceptions but when
8N0IZZpF8ts,564,00:10:05.040,00:10:05.050,there are lots of exceptions but when
8N0IZZpF8ts,565,00:10:05.050,00:10:07.110,there are lots of exceptions but when you see tons of Padgett widespread when
8N0IZZpF8ts,566,00:10:07.110,00:10:07.120,you see tons of Padgett widespread when
8N0IZZpF8ts,567,00:10:07.120,00:10:08.310,you see tons of Padgett widespread when you see patch hoods spread at the
8N0IZZpF8ts,568,00:10:08.310,00:10:08.320,you see patch hoods spread at the
8N0IZZpF8ts,569,00:10:08.320,00:10:09.840,you see patch hoods spread at the periphery of the lesion those are

8N0IZZpF8ts,571,00:10:09.850,00:10:12.030,periphery of the lesion those are worrying signs for melanoma okay
8N0IZZpF8ts,572,00:10:12.030,00:10:12.040,worrying signs for melanoma okay
8N0IZZpF8ts,573,00:10:12.040,00:10:13.410,worrying signs for melanoma okay and again that's why I selected this
8N0IZZpF8ts,574,00:10:13.410,00:10:13.420,and again that's why I selected this
8N0IZZpF8ts,575,00:10:13.420,00:10:15.150,and again that's why I selected this case because it's unbelievable amount of
8N0IZZpF8ts,576,00:10:15.150,00:10:15.160,case because it's unbelievable amount of
8N0IZZpF8ts,577,00:10:15.160,00:10:17.580,case because it's unbelievable amount of Paget oh it spread and you know one
8N0IZZpF8ts,578,00:10:17.580,00:10:17.590,Paget oh it spread and you know one
8N0IZZpF8ts,579,00:10:17.590,00:10:19.140,Paget oh it spread and you know one thing I'll point out is unlike squamous
8N0IZZpF8ts,580,00:10:19.140,00:10:19.150,thing I'll point out is unlike squamous
8N0IZZpF8ts,581,00:10:19.150,00:10:21.270,thing I'll point out is unlike squamous cell carcinoma in situ even when you
8N0IZZpF8ts,582,00:10:21.270,00:10:21.280,cell carcinoma in situ even when you
8N0IZZpF8ts,583,00:10:21.280,00:10:23.520,cell carcinoma in situ even when you have a floor at amount of atypical
8N0IZZpF8ts,584,00:10:23.520,00:10:23.530,have a floor at amount of atypical
8N0IZZpF8ts,585,00:10:23.530,00:10:25.110,have a floor at amount of atypical melanocytes and patch enjoyed spread
8N0IZZpF8ts,586,00:10:25.110,00:10:25.120,melanocytes and patch enjoyed spread
8N0IZZpF8ts,587,00:10:25.120,00:10:27.690,melanocytes and patch enjoyed spread they don't usually fully replace the
8N0IZZpF8ts,588,00:10:27.690,00:10:27.700,they don't usually fully replace the
8N0IZZpF8ts,589,00:10:27.700,00:10:29.610,they don't usually fully replace the epidermis I've seen occasional times
8N0IZZpF8ts,590,00:10:29.610,00:10:29.620,epidermis I've seen occasional times
8N0IZZpF8ts,591,00:10:29.620,00:10:31.260,epidermis I've seen occasional times where they can almost replace it or kind
8N0IZZpF8ts,592,00:10:31.260,00:10:31.270,where they can almost replace it or kind
8N0IZZpF8ts,593,00:10:31.270,00:10:34.650,where they can almost replace it or kind of consume it with large nests and but
8N0IZZpF8ts,594,00:10:34.650,00:10:34.660,of consume it with large nests and but
8N0IZZpF8ts,595,00:10:34.660,00:10:36.210,of consume it with large nests and but but you usually will have them
8N0IZZpF8ts,596,00:10:36.210,00:10:36.220,but you usually will have them
8N0IZZpF8ts,597,00:10:36.220,00:10:37.860,but you usually will have them intervened with there see there's pink
8N0IZZpF8ts,598,00:10:37.860,00:10:37.870,intervened with there see there's pink
8N0IZZpF8ts,599,00:10:37.870,00:10:39.780,intervened with there see there's pink keratinocytes in between all of these
8N0IZZpF8ts,600,00:10:39.780,00:10:39.790,keratinocytes in between all of these
8N0IZZpF8ts,601,00:10:39.790,00:10:42.390,keratinocytes in between all of these nests and single Paget own cells okay
8N0IZZpF8ts,602,00:10:42.390,00:10:42.400,nests and single Paget own cells okay
8N0IZZpF8ts,603,00:10:42.400,00:10:45.270,nests and single Paget own cells okay and so that's a useful thing that in in
8N0IZZpF8ts,604,00:10:45.270,00:10:45.280,and so that's a useful thing that in in
8N0IZZpF8ts,605,00:10:45.280,00:10:47.520,and so that's a useful thing that in in squamous site - you will usually you may
8N0IZZpF8ts,606,00:10:47.520,00:10:47.530,squamous site - you will usually you may
8N0IZZpF8ts,607,00:10:47.530,00:10:48.720,squamous site - you will usually you may have areas that look kind of like this
8N0IZZpF8ts,608,00:10:48.720,00:10:48.730,have areas that look kind of like this
8N0IZZpF8ts,609,00:10:48.730,00:10:50.130,have areas that look kind of like this but you'll also have other areas usually
8N0IZZpF8ts,610,00:10:50.130,00:10:50.140,but you'll also have other areas usually
8N0IZZpF8ts,611,00:10:50.140,00:10:53.070,but you'll also have other areas usually a full thickness epidermal atypia and
8N0IZZpF8ts,612,00:10:53.070,00:10:53.080,a full thickness epidermal atypia and
8N0IZZpF8ts,613,00:10:53.080,00:10:54.990,a full thickness epidermal atypia and that's a useful clue on H&amp;E to tell
8N0IZZpF8ts,614,00:10:54.990,00:10:55.000,that's a useful clue on H&amp;E to tell
8N0IZZpF8ts,615,00:10:55.000,00:10:57.830,that's a useful clue on H&amp;E to tell apart a squamous sites you from melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,616,00:10:57.830,00:10:57.840,apart a squamous sites you from melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,617,00:10:57.840,00:11:01.050,apart a squamous sites you from melanoma okay and here again it's just it's an
8N0IZZpF8ts,618,00:11:01.050,00:11:01.060,okay and here again it's just it's an
8N0IZZpF8ts,619,00:11:01.060,00:11:02.850,okay and here again it's just it's an amazing amount of patch Toit spread that
8N0IZZpF8ts,620,00:11:02.850,00:11:02.860,amazing amount of patch Toit spread that
8N0IZZpF8ts,621,00:11:02.860,00:11:04.890,amazing amount of patch Toit spread that the patch type melanocytes are breaking
8N0IZZpF8ts,622,00:11:04.890,00:11:04.900,the patch type melanocytes are breaking
8N0IZZpF8ts,623,00:11:04.900,00:11:06.750,the patch type melanocytes are breaking through the epidermis here
8N0IZZpF8ts,624,00:11:06.750,00:11:06.760,through the epidermis here
8N0IZZpF8ts,625,00:11:06.760,00:11:08.700,through the epidermis here kind of even coming out into the corneal
8N0IZZpF8ts,626,00:11:08.700,00:11:08.710,kind of even coming out into the corneal
8N0IZZpF8ts,627,00:11:08.710,00:11:11.520,kind of even coming out into the corneal layer we don't always see that but
8N0IZZpF8ts,628,00:11:11.520,00:11:11.530,layer we don't always see that but
8N0IZZpF8ts,629,00:11:11.530,00:11:13.650,layer we don't always see that but sometimes we do okay and what we have
8N0IZZpF8ts,630,00:11:13.650,00:11:13.660,sometimes we do okay and what we have
8N0IZZpF8ts,631,00:11:13.660,00:11:15.300,sometimes we do okay and what we have this let's look closer and see the
8N0IZZpF8ts,632,00:11:15.300,00:11:15.310,this let's look closer and see the
8N0IZZpF8ts,633,00:11:15.310,00:11:18.420,this let's look closer and see the cytologic features so obviously
8N0IZZpF8ts,634,00:11:18.420,00:11:18.430,cytologic features so obviously
8N0IZZpF8ts,635,00:11:18.430,00:11:20.100,cytologic features so obviously cytologic atypia is something that we
8N0IZZpF8ts,636,00:11:20.100,00:11:20.110,cytologic atypia is something that we
8N0IZZpF8ts,637,00:11:20.110,00:11:23.820,cytologic atypia is something that we often see in melanomas okay and atypia
8N0IZZpF8ts,638,00:11:23.820,00:11:23.830,often see in melanomas okay and atypia
8N0IZZpF8ts,639,00:11:23.830,00:11:26.130,often see in melanomas okay and atypia is can be a little bit hard to evaluate
8N0IZZpF8ts,640,00:11:26.130,00:11:26.140,is can be a little bit hard to evaluate
8N0IZZpF8ts,641,00:11:26.140,00:11:28.230,is can be a little bit hard to evaluate and as Bruce smaller one of my mentors
8N0IZZpF8ts,642,00:11:28.230,00:11:28.240,and as Bruce smaller one of my mentors
8N0IZZpF8ts,643,00:11:28.240,00:11:30.600,and as Bruce smaller one of my mentors said atypia is in the eye of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,644,00:11:30.600,00:11:30.610,said atypia is in the eye of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,645,00:11:30.610,00:11:32.820,said atypia is in the eye of the beholder and while some people might
8N0IZZpF8ts,646,00:11:32.820,00:11:32.830,beholder and while some people might
8N0IZZpF8ts,647,00:11:32.830,00:11:34.530,beholder and while some people might disagree with that I think in my
8N0IZZpF8ts,648,00:11:34.530,00:11:34.540,disagree with that I think in my
8N0IZZpF8ts,649,00:11:34.540,00:11:36.480,disagree with that I think in my experience that's actually proven to be
8N0IZZpF8ts,650,00:11:36.480,00:11:36.490,experience that's actually proven to be
8N0IZZpF8ts,651,00:11:36.490,00:11:38.700,experience that's actually proven to be true sometimes things might seem a
8N0IZZpF8ts,652,00:11:38.700,00:11:38.710,true sometimes things might seem a
8N0IZZpF8ts,653,00:11:38.710,00:11:40.350,true sometimes things might seem a typical to me and one of my colleagues
8N0IZZpF8ts,654,00:11:40.350,00:11:40.360,typical to me and one of my colleagues
8N0IZZpF8ts,655,00:11:40.360,00:11:42.210,typical to me and one of my colleagues might not think it looks cytologically
8N0IZZpF8ts,656,00:11:42.210,00:11:42.220,might not think it looks cytologically
8N0IZZpF8ts,657,00:11:42.220,00:11:44.250,might not think it looks cytologically atypical and also it depends on the
8N0IZZpF8ts,658,00:11:44.250,00:11:44.260,atypical and also it depends on the
8N0IZZpF8ts,659,00:11:44.260,00:11:45.990,atypical and also it depends on the clinical context again I've seen
8N0IZZpF8ts,660,00:11:45.990,00:11:46.000,clinical context again I've seen
8N0IZZpF8ts,661,00:11:46.000,00:11:47.850,clinical context again I've seen congenital knee viand young kids that
8N0IZZpF8ts,662,00:11:47.850,00:11:47.860,congenital knee viand young kids that
8N0IZZpF8ts,663,00:11:47.860,00:11:49.980,congenital knee viand young kids that have big cells that if you would put
8N0IZZpF8ts,664,00:11:49.980,00:11:49.990,have big cells that if you would put
8N0IZZpF8ts,665,00:11:49.990,00:11:52.980,have big cells that if you would put that cell in a junctional mole an acidic
8N0IZZpF8ts,666,00:11:52.980,00:11:52.990,that cell in a junctional mole an acidic
8N0IZZpF8ts,667,00:11:52.990,00:11:55.410,that cell in a junctional mole an acidic lesion in the scalp of an 80 year old
8N0IZZpF8ts,668,00:11:55.410,00:11:55.420,lesion in the scalp of an 80 year old
8N0IZZpF8ts,669,00:11:55.420,00:11:57.360,lesion in the scalp of an 80 year old sun-damaged person I would say that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,670,00:11:57.360,00:11:57.370,sun-damaged person I would say that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,671,00:11:57.370,00:12:00.060,sun-damaged person I would say that's super atypical severe atypia but if you
8N0IZZpF8ts,672,00:12:00.060,00:12:00.070,super atypical severe atypia but if you
8N0IZZpF8ts,673,00:12:00.070,00:12:01.620,super atypical severe atypia but if you put it in a congenital nevus that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,674,00:12:01.620,00:12:01.630,put it in a congenital nevus that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,675,00:12:01.630,00:12:03.720,put it in a congenital nevus that's obviously benign in a baby I'd say oh
8N0IZZpF8ts,676,00:12:03.720,00:12:03.730,obviously benign in a baby I'd say oh
8N0IZZpF8ts,677,00:12:03.730,00:12:05.310,obviously benign in a baby I'd say oh that's just some random nuclear
8N0IZZpF8ts,678,00:12:05.310,00:12:05.320,that's just some random nuclear
8N0IZZpF8ts,679,00:12:05.320,00:12:08.310,that's just some random nuclear enlargement so you do have to keep in
8N0IZZpF8ts,680,00:12:08.310,00:12:08.320,enlargement so you do have to keep in
8N0IZZpF8ts,681,00:12:08.320,00:12:09.990,enlargement so you do have to keep in mind that atypia can be somewhat
8N0IZZpF8ts,682,00:12:09.990,00:12:10.000,mind that atypia can be somewhat
8N0IZZpF8ts,683,00:12:10.000,00:12:12.690,mind that atypia can be somewhat subjective and the context matters but I
8N0IZZpF8ts,684,00:12:12.690,00:12:12.700,subjective and the context matters but I
8N0IZZpF8ts,685,00:12:12.700,00:12:14.430,subjective and the context matters but I think here even you know medical
8N0IZZpF8ts,686,00:12:14.430,00:12:14.440,think here even you know medical
8N0IZZpF8ts,687,00:12:14.440,00:12:16.170,think here even you know medical students and even junior trainees would
8N0IZZpF8ts,688,00:12:16.170,00:12:16.180,students and even junior trainees would
8N0IZZpF8ts,689,00:12:16.180,00:12:17.940,students and even junior trainees would agree these cells are really atypical
8N0IZZpF8ts,690,00:12:17.940,00:12:17.950,agree these cells are really atypical
8N0IZZpF8ts,691,00:12:17.950,00:12:20.100,agree these cells are really atypical they're huge way bigger than normal
8N0IZZpF8ts,692,00:12:20.100,00:12:20.110,they're huge way bigger than normal
8N0IZZpF8ts,693,00:12:20.110,00:12:21.660,they're huge way bigger than normal melanocytes they're even bigger than the
8N0IZZpF8ts,694,00:12:21.660,00:12:21.670,melanocytes they're even bigger than the
8N0IZZpF8ts,695,00:12:21.670,00:12:23.910,melanocytes they're even bigger than the adjacent keratinocytes they have very
8N0IZZpF8ts,696,00:12:23.910,00:12:23.920,adjacent keratinocytes they have very
8N0IZZpF8ts,697,00:12:23.920,00:12:27.450,adjacent keratinocytes they have very large nuclei in the center and people
8N0IZZpF8ts,698,00:12:27.450,00:12:27.460,large nuclei in the center and people
8N0IZZpF8ts,699,00:12:27.460,00:12:29.220,large nuclei in the center and people often talk about melanoma as having
8N0IZZpF8ts,700,00:12:29.220,00:12:29.230,often talk about melanoma as having
8N0IZZpF8ts,701,00:12:29.230,00:12:31.590,often talk about melanoma as having cherry-red nucleoli but actually all
8N0IZZpF8ts,702,00:12:31.590,00:12:31.600,cherry-red nucleoli but actually all
8N0IZZpF8ts,703,00:12:31.600,00:12:34.920,cherry-red nucleoli but actually all nucleoli tend to have a reddish a
8N0IZZpF8ts,704,00:12:34.920,00:12:34.930,nucleoli tend to have a reddish a
8N0IZZpF8ts,705,00:12:34.930,00:12:37.440,nucleoli tend to have a reddish a reddish color to them and that's because
8N0IZZpF8ts,706,00:12:37.440,00:12:37.450,reddish color to them and that's because
8N0IZZpF8ts,707,00:12:37.450,00:12:39.270,reddish color to them and that's because there are proteins ribosomal proteins
8N0IZZpF8ts,708,00:12:39.270,00:12:39.280,there are proteins ribosomal proteins
8N0IZZpF8ts,709,00:12:39.280,00:12:41.820,there are proteins ribosomal proteins going in and fusing with ribosomal RNA
8N0IZZpF8ts,710,00:12:41.820,00:12:41.830,going in and fusing with ribosomal RNA
8N0IZZpF8ts,711,00:12:41.830,00:12:44.190,going in and fusing with ribosomal RNA within the nucleus at least that's what
8N0IZZpF8ts,712,00:12:44.190,00:12:44.200,within the nucleus at least that's what
8N0IZZpF8ts,713,00:12:44.200,00:12:45.510,within the nucleus at least that's what I've been told and that explains why
8N0IZZpF8ts,714,00:12:45.510,00:12:45.520,I've been told and that explains why
8N0IZZpF8ts,715,00:12:45.520,00:12:46.770,I've been told and that explains why there's more of that kind of reddish
8N0IZZpF8ts,716,00:12:46.770,00:12:46.780,there's more of that kind of reddish
8N0IZZpF8ts,717,00:12:46.780,00:12:49.380,there's more of that kind of reddish pink color to the nuclei but melanoma do
8N0IZZpF8ts,718,00:12:49.380,00:12:49.390,pink color to the nuclei but melanoma do
8N0IZZpF8ts,719,00:12:49.390,00:12:51.570,pink color to the nuclei but melanoma do often have big nuclei and they're often
8N0IZZpF8ts,720,00:12:51.570,00:12:51.580,often have big nuclei and they're often
8N0IZZpF8ts,721,00:12:51.580,00:12:53.580,often have big nuclei and they're often kind of that reddish color and we can
8N0IZZpF8ts,722,00:12:53.580,00:12:53.590,kind of that reddish color and we can
8N0IZZpF8ts,723,00:12:53.590,00:12:55.080,kind of that reddish color and we can also see in this example here plea
8N0IZZpF8ts,724,00:12:55.080,00:12:55.090,also see in this example here plea
8N0IZZpF8ts,725,00:12:55.090,00:12:56.550,also see in this example here plea amorphous and we can see that some of
8N0IZZpF8ts,726,00:12:56.550,00:12:56.560,amorphous and we can see that some of
8N0IZZpF8ts,727,00:12:56.560,00:12:58.380,amorphous and we can see that some of the cells are very large and whereas
8N0IZZpF8ts,728,00:12:58.380,00:12:58.390,the cells are very large and whereas
8N0IZZpF8ts,729,00:12:58.390,00:13:00.480,the cells are very large and whereas other tumor cells are smaller so we have
8N0IZZpF8ts,730,00:13:00.480,00:13:00.490,other tumor cells are smaller so we have
8N0IZZpF8ts,731,00:13:00.490,00:13:02.450,other tumor cells are smaller so we have a variation of size and shape of
8N0IZZpF8ts,732,00:13:02.450,00:13:02.460,a variation of size and shape of
8N0IZZpF8ts,733,00:13:02.460,00:13:04.890,a variation of size and shape of multiple times the largest tumor cell is
8N0IZZpF8ts,734,00:13:04.890,00:13:04.900,multiple times the largest tumor cell is
8N0IZZpF8ts,735,00:13:04.900,00:13:06.300,multiple times the largest tumor cell is multiple times bigger than the smallest
8N0IZZpF8ts,736,00:13:06.300,00:13:06.310,multiple times bigger than the smallest
8N0IZZpF8ts,737,00:13:06.310,00:13:09.510,multiple times bigger than the smallest tumor cell we also the chromatin pattern
8N0IZZpF8ts,738,00:13:09.510,00:13:09.520,tumor cell we also the chromatin pattern
8N0IZZpF8ts,739,00:13:09.520,00:13:11.700,tumor cell we also the chromatin pattern of melanoma it can vary but a lot of
8N0IZZpF8ts,740,00:13:11.700,00:13:11.710,of melanoma it can vary but a lot of
8N0IZZpF8ts,741,00:13:11.710,00:13:14.220,of melanoma it can vary but a lot of times its kind of coarse or chunky
8N0IZZpF8ts,742,00:13:14.220,00:13:14.230,times its kind of coarse or chunky
8N0IZZpF8ts,743,00:13:14.230,00:13:15.540,times its kind of coarse or chunky chromatin where you'll have areas that
8N0IZZpF8ts,744,00:13:15.540,00:13:15.550,chromatin where you'll have areas that
8N0IZZpF8ts,745,00:13:15.550,00:13:17.820,chromatin where you'll have areas that are pale and then blobs of darker
8N0IZZpF8ts,746,00:13:17.820,00:13:17.830,are pale and then blobs of darker
8N0IZZpF8ts,747,00:13:17.830,00:13:19.890,are pale and then blobs of darker chromatin sometimes it can be diffusely
8N0IZZpF8ts,748,00:13:19.890,00:13:19.900,chromatin sometimes it can be diffusely
8N0IZZpF8ts,749,00:13:19.900,00:13:20.610,chromatin sometimes it can be diffusely hyper cream
8N0IZZpF8ts,750,00:13:20.610,00:13:20.620,hyper cream
8N0IZZpF8ts,751,00:13:20.620,00:13:22.050,hyper cream sometimes it can be very pale and
8N0IZZpF8ts,752,00:13:22.050,00:13:22.060,sometimes it can be very pale and
8N0IZZpF8ts,753,00:13:22.060,00:13:23.910,sometimes it can be very pale and vesicular but a lot of times its kind of
8N0IZZpF8ts,754,00:13:23.910,00:13:23.920,vesicular but a lot of times its kind of
8N0IZZpF8ts,755,00:13:23.920,00:13:28.260,vesicular but a lot of times its kind of a coarse horse chromatin pattern okay so
8N0IZZpF8ts,756,00:13:28.260,00:13:28.270,a coarse horse chromatin pattern okay so
8N0IZZpF8ts,757,00:13:28.270,00:13:30.930,a coarse horse chromatin pattern okay so these are very atypical cells and they
8N0IZZpF8ts,758,00:13:30.930,00:13:30.940,these are very atypical cells and they
8N0IZZpF8ts,759,00:13:30.940,00:13:32.970,these are very atypical cells and they are melanocytes and you can see here
8N0IZZpF8ts,760,00:13:32.970,00:13:32.980,are melanocytes and you can see here
8N0IZZpF8ts,761,00:13:32.980,00:13:34.710,are melanocytes and you can see here that their melanocytes melanocytes

8N0IZZpF8ts,763,00:13:34.720,00:13:37.740,that their melanocytes melanocytes oftentimes in normal skin have a pink or
8N0IZZpF8ts,764,00:13:37.740,00:13:37.750,oftentimes in normal skin have a pink or
8N0IZZpF8ts,765,00:13:37.750,00:13:40.380,oftentimes in normal skin have a pink or gray cytoplasm with very little if any

8N0IZZpF8ts,767,00:13:40.390,00:13:42.660,gray cytoplasm with very little if any visible melanin pigment and again in my
8N0IZZpF8ts,768,00:13:42.660,00:13:42.670,visible melanin pigment and again in my
8N0IZZpF8ts,769,00:13:42.670,00:13:44.460,visible melanin pigment and again in my normal skin histology video I talked
8N0IZZpF8ts,770,00:13:44.460,00:13:44.470,normal skin histology video I talked
8N0IZZpF8ts,771,00:13:44.470,00:13:46.800,normal skin histology video I talked about that to some extent Malayan acidic
8N0IZZpF8ts,772,00:13:46.800,00:13:46.810,about that to some extent Malayan acidic
8N0IZZpF8ts,773,00:13:46.810,00:13:49.740,about that to some extent Malayan acidic lesions oftentimes will have melanin
8N0IZZpF8ts,774,00:13:49.740,00:13:49.750,lesions oftentimes will have melanin
8N0IZZpF8ts,775,00:13:49.750,00:13:51.000,lesions oftentimes will have melanin pigment with them but the melanin
8N0IZZpF8ts,776,00:13:51.000,00:13:51.010,pigment with them but the melanin
8N0IZZpF8ts,777,00:13:51.010,00:13:53.010,pigment with them but the melanin pigment is still usually prominent in
8N0IZZpF8ts,778,00:13:53.010,00:13:53.020,pigment is still usually prominent in
8N0IZZpF8ts,779,00:13:53.020,00:13:55.320,pigment is still usually prominent in the keratinocytes not in the melanocytes
8N0IZZpF8ts,780,00:13:55.320,00:13:55.330,the keratinocytes not in the melanocytes
8N0IZZpF8ts,781,00:13:55.330,00:13:57.240,the keratinocytes not in the melanocytes melanocytes normally make melanin
8N0IZZpF8ts,782,00:13:57.240,00:13:57.250,melanocytes normally make melanin
8N0IZZpF8ts,783,00:13:57.250,00:13:59.160,melanocytes normally make melanin pigment and transfer it to adjacent
8N0IZZpF8ts,784,00:13:59.160,00:13:59.170,pigment and transfer it to adjacent
8N0IZZpF8ts,785,00:13:59.170,00:14:00.960,pigment and transfer it to adjacent keratinocytes in the basal layer that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,786,00:14:00.960,00:14:00.970,keratinocytes in the basal layer that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,787,00:14:00.970,00:14:03.330,keratinocytes in the basal layer that's the normal normal physiology of
8N0IZZpF8ts,788,00:14:03.330,00:14:03.340,the normal normal physiology of
8N0IZZpF8ts,789,00:14:03.340,00:14:07.110,the normal normal physiology of melanocytes in the skin okay but
8N0IZZpF8ts,790,00:14:07.110,00:14:07.120,melanocytes in the skin okay but
8N0IZZpF8ts,791,00:14:07.120,00:14:09.300,melanocytes in the skin okay but sometimes melanocytes can make pigment
8N0IZZpF8ts,792,00:14:09.300,00:14:09.310,sometimes melanocytes can make pigment
8N0IZZpF8ts,793,00:14:09.310,00:14:10.950,sometimes melanocytes can make pigment and the pigment will build up in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,794,00:14:10.950,00:14:10.960,and the pigment will build up in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,795,00:14:10.960,00:14:13.830,and the pigment will build up in the cytoplasm of the of the melanocytes you
8N0IZZpF8ts,796,00:14:13.830,00:14:13.840,cytoplasm of the of the melanocytes you
8N0IZZpF8ts,797,00:14:13.840,00:14:16.230,cytoplasm of the of the melanocytes you both in niva and in melanoma okay so
8N0IZZpF8ts,798,00:14:16.230,00:14:16.240,both in niva and in melanoma okay so
8N0IZZpF8ts,799,00:14:16.240,00:14:19.140,both in niva and in melanoma okay so that's important because being able to
8N0IZZpF8ts,800,00:14:19.140,00:14:19.150,that's important because being able to
8N0IZZpF8ts,801,00:14:19.150,00:14:22.080,that's important because being able to tell pigment that is a Melania suddenly
8N0IZZpF8ts,802,00:14:22.080,00:14:22.090,tell pigment that is a Melania suddenly
8N0IZZpF8ts,803,00:14:22.090,00:14:24.060,tell pigment that is a Melania suddenly anaesthetic cell versus some other cell
8N0IZZpF8ts,804,00:14:24.060,00:14:24.070,anaesthetic cell versus some other cell
8N0IZZpF8ts,805,00:14:24.070,00:14:25.260,anaesthetic cell versus some other cell is really important because sometimes
8N0IZZpF8ts,806,00:14:25.260,00:14:25.270,is really important because sometimes
8N0IZZpF8ts,807,00:14:25.270,00:14:27.330,is really important because sometimes that will impact your ability to decide
8N0IZZpF8ts,808,00:14:27.330,00:14:27.340,that will impact your ability to decide
8N0IZZpF8ts,809,00:14:27.340,00:14:29.010,that will impact your ability to decide if the tumors actually invasive or
8N0IZZpF8ts,810,00:14:29.010,00:14:29.020,if the tumors actually invasive or
8N0IZZpF8ts,811,00:14:29.020,00:14:31.170,if the tumors actually invasive or something else so when you have a really
8N0IZZpF8ts,812,00:14:31.170,00:14:31.180,something else so when you have a really
8N0IZZpF8ts,813,00:14:31.180,00:14:34.290,something else so when you have a really dense chunks of pigment a lot of times
8N0IZZpF8ts,814,00:14:34.290,00:14:34.300,dense chunks of pigment a lot of times
8N0IZZpF8ts,815,00:14:34.300,00:14:36.810,dense chunks of pigment a lot of times that will indicate a cell like here in
8N0IZZpF8ts,816,00:14:36.810,00:14:36.820,that will indicate a cell like here in
8N0IZZpF8ts,817,00:14:36.820,00:14:39.390,that will indicate a cell like here in the dermis look these dense clumps of
8N0IZZpF8ts,818,00:14:39.390,00:14:39.400,the dermis look these dense clumps of
8N0IZZpF8ts,819,00:14:39.400,00:14:41.130,the dermis look these dense clumps of melanin pigment these are actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,820,00:14:41.130,00:14:41.140,melanin pigment these are actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,821,00:14:41.140,00:14:42.900,melanin pigment these are actually melania phages this is melanin that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,822,00:14:42.900,00:14:42.910,melania phages this is melanin that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,823,00:14:42.910,00:14:44.640,melania phages this is melanin that's fallen out of the epidermis into the
8N0IZZpF8ts,824,00:14:44.640,00:14:44.650,fallen out of the epidermis into the
8N0IZZpF8ts,825,00:14:44.650,00:14:46.860,fallen out of the epidermis into the dermis and is eaten up by macrophages
8N0IZZpF8ts,826,00:14:46.860,00:14:46.870,dermis and is eaten up by macrophages
8N0IZZpF8ts,827,00:14:46.870,00:14:49.170,dermis and is eaten up by macrophages so usually really darkly pigmented cells
8N0IZZpF8ts,828,00:14:49.170,00:14:49.180,so usually really darkly pigmented cells
8N0IZZpF8ts,829,00:14:49.180,00:14:51.570,so usually really darkly pigmented cells tend to not be melanocytes but there are
8N0IZZpF8ts,830,00:14:51.570,00:14:51.580,tend to not be melanocytes but there are
8N0IZZpF8ts,831,00:14:51.580,00:14:53.490,tend to not be melanocytes but there are some exceptions and here's here's one
8N0IZZpF8ts,832,00:14:53.490,00:14:53.500,some exceptions and here's here's one
8N0IZZpF8ts,833,00:14:53.500,00:14:54.810,some exceptions and here's here's one example where you're starting to see
8N0IZZpF8ts,834,00:14:54.810,00:14:54.820,example where you're starting to see
8N0IZZpF8ts,835,00:14:54.820,00:14:56.460,example where you're starting to see some of the melanocytes picking up a
8N0IZZpF8ts,836,00:14:56.460,00:14:56.470,some of the melanocytes picking up a
8N0IZZpF8ts,837,00:14:56.470,00:14:58.170,some of the melanocytes picking up a fair amount or having a fair amount of
8N0IZZpF8ts,838,00:14:58.170,00:14:58.180,fair amount or having a fair amount of
8N0IZZpF8ts,839,00:14:58.180,00:14:59.720,fair amount or having a fair amount of melanin building up in their cytoplasm
8N0IZZpF8ts,840,00:14:59.720,00:14:59.730,melanin building up in their cytoplasm
8N0IZZpF8ts,841,00:14:59.730,00:15:02.190,melanin building up in their cytoplasm usually I would say when you see pigment
8N0IZZpF8ts,842,00:15:02.190,00:15:02.200,usually I would say when you see pigment
8N0IZZpF8ts,843,00:15:02.200,00:15:04.110,usually I would say when you see pigment in melanoma cells though it looks like
8N0IZZpF8ts,844,00:15:04.110,00:15:04.120,in melanoma cells though it looks like
8N0IZZpF8ts,845,00:15:04.120,00:15:06.710,in melanoma cells though it looks like this this kind of dusty or dirty
8N0IZZpF8ts,846,00:15:06.710,00:15:06.720,this this kind of dusty or dirty
8N0IZZpF8ts,847,00:15:06.720,00:15:09.390,this this kind of dusty or dirty brownish gray cytoplasm so we have this
8N0IZZpF8ts,848,00:15:09.390,00:15:09.400,brownish gray cytoplasm so we have this
8N0IZZpF8ts,849,00:15:09.400,00:15:11.280,brownish gray cytoplasm so we have this kind of grayish cytoplasm that has
8N0IZZpF8ts,850,00:15:11.280,00:15:11.290,kind of grayish cytoplasm that has
8N0IZZpF8ts,851,00:15:11.290,00:15:13.100,kind of grayish cytoplasm that has little specks little stipple x' of
8N0IZZpF8ts,852,00:15:13.100,00:15:13.110,little specks little stipple x' of
8N0IZZpF8ts,853,00:15:13.110,00:15:16.380,little specks little stipple x' of melanin pigment in the cytoplasm okay so
8N0IZZpF8ts,854,00:15:16.380,00:15:16.390,melanin pigment in the cytoplasm okay so
8N0IZZpF8ts,855,00:15:16.390,00:15:17.580,melanin pigment in the cytoplasm okay so I think that's pretty helpful that
8N0IZZpF8ts,856,00:15:17.580,00:15:17.590,I think that's pretty helpful that
8N0IZZpF8ts,857,00:15:17.590,00:15:21.510,I think that's pretty helpful that grayish cytoplasm with little fine
8N0IZZpF8ts,858,00:15:21.510,00:15:21.520,grayish cytoplasm with little fine
8N0IZZpF8ts,859,00:15:21.520,00:15:24.090,grayish cytoplasm with little fine granules of melanin you can see that in
8N0IZZpF8ts,860,00:15:24.090,00:15:24.100,granules of melanin you can see that in
8N0IZZpF8ts,861,00:15:24.100,00:15:28.320,granules of melanin you can see that in some examples of melanoma okay but again
8N0IZZpF8ts,862,00:15:28.320,00:15:28.330,some examples of melanoma okay but again
8N0IZZpF8ts,863,00:15:28.330,00:15:29.820,some examples of melanoma okay but again all of this pigment down here
8N0IZZpF8ts,864,00:15:29.820,00:15:29.830,all of this pigment down here
8N0IZZpF8ts,865,00:15:29.830,00:15:31.500,all of this pigment down here this belongs these are Emiliano phage is
8N0IZZpF8ts,866,00:15:31.500,00:15:31.510,this belongs these are Emiliano phage is
8N0IZZpF8ts,867,00:15:31.510,00:15:34.290,this belongs these are Emiliano phage is not invasion so even though this melon
8N0IZZpF8ts,868,00:15:34.290,00:15:34.300,not invasion so even though this melon
8N0IZZpF8ts,869,00:15:34.300,00:15:36.090,not invasion so even though this melon is really exuberant there's tons of
8N0IZZpF8ts,870,00:15:36.090,00:15:36.100,is really exuberant there's tons of
8N0IZZpF8ts,871,00:15:36.100,00:15:38.640,is really exuberant there's tons of cells almost all of it is in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,872,00:15:38.640,00:15:38.650,cells almost all of it is in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,873,00:15:38.650,00:15:40.320,cells almost all of it is in the epidermis see you can look down to the
8N0IZZpF8ts,874,00:15:40.320,00:15:40.330,epidermis see you can look down to the
8N0IZZpF8ts,875,00:15:40.330,00:15:42.390,epidermis see you can look down to the dermis and we we see inflammation in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,876,00:15:42.390,00:15:42.400,dermis and we we see inflammation in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,877,00:15:42.400,00:15:44.250,dermis and we we see inflammation in the dermis a host response that the
8N0IZZpF8ts,878,00:15:44.250,00:15:44.260,dermis a host response that the
8N0IZZpF8ts,879,00:15:44.260,00:15:45.780,dermis a host response that the inflammation that's responding to this
8N0IZZpF8ts,880,00:15:45.780,00:15:45.790,inflammation that's responding to this
8N0IZZpF8ts,881,00:15:45.790,00:15:48.270,inflammation that's responding to this overlying tumor but there's actually no
8N0IZZpF8ts,882,00:15:48.270,00:15:48.280,overlying tumor but there's actually no
8N0IZZpF8ts,883,00:15:48.280,00:15:50.730,overlying tumor but there's actually no invasion of melanoma past the basement
8N0IZZpF8ts,884,00:15:50.730,00:15:50.740,invasion of melanoma past the basement
8N0IZZpF8ts,885,00:15:50.740,00:15:54.090,invasion of melanoma past the basement membrane let's look here again is
8N0IZZpF8ts,886,00:15:54.090,00:15:54.100,membrane let's look here again is
8N0IZZpF8ts,887,00:15:54.100,00:15:58.320,membrane let's look here again is another example of cytologic atypia if I
8N0IZZpF8ts,888,00:15:58.320,00:15:58.330,another example of cytologic atypia if I
8N0IZZpF8ts,889,00:15:58.330,00:16:03.360,another example of cytologic atypia if I can get it into focus here huge a
8N0IZZpF8ts,890,00:16:03.360,00:16:03.370,can get it into focus here huge a
8N0IZZpF8ts,891,00:16:03.370,00:16:05.790,can get it into focus here huge a typical melanocytes right along here
8N0IZZpF8ts,892,00:16:05.790,00:16:05.800,typical melanocytes right along here
8N0IZZpF8ts,893,00:16:05.800,00:16:08.340,typical melanocytes right along here okay and there's a mitosis - now we'll
8N0IZZpF8ts,894,00:16:08.340,00:16:08.350,okay and there's a mitosis - now we'll
8N0IZZpF8ts,895,00:16:08.350,00:16:09.570,okay and there's a mitosis - now we'll talk about my testes in a minute but you
8N0IZZpF8ts,896,00:16:09.570,00:16:09.580,talk about my testes in a minute but you
8N0IZZpF8ts,897,00:16:09.580,00:16:11.940,talk about my testes in a minute but you have to be careful about mitosis in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,898,00:16:11.940,00:16:11.950,have to be careful about mitosis in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,899,00:16:11.950,00:16:13.980,have to be careful about mitosis in the epidermal portion of amyl anesthetic
8N0IZZpF8ts,900,00:16:13.980,00:16:13.990,epidermal portion of amyl anesthetic
8N0IZZpF8ts,901,00:16:13.990,00:16:16.230,epidermal portion of amyl anesthetic lesion okay the reason it's not that
8N0IZZpF8ts,902,00:16:16.230,00:16:16.240,lesion okay the reason it's not that
8N0IZZpF8ts,903,00:16:16.240,00:16:17.670,lesion okay the reason it's not that they're not important there there have
8N0IZZpF8ts,904,00:16:17.670,00:16:17.680,they're not important there there have
8N0IZZpF8ts,905,00:16:17.680,00:16:20.550,they're not important there there have been some some recent studies that have
8N0IZZpF8ts,906,00:16:20.550,00:16:20.560,been some some recent studies that have
8N0IZZpF8ts,907,00:16:20.560,00:16:23.250,been some some recent studies that have shown that actually junctional mitosis
8N0IZZpF8ts,908,00:16:23.250,00:16:23.260,shown that actually junctional mitosis
8N0IZZpF8ts,909,00:16:23.260,00:16:25.200,shown that actually junctional mitosis are more frequently seen in melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,910,00:16:25.200,00:16:25.210,are more frequently seen in melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,911,00:16:25.210,00:16:27.870,are more frequently seen in melanoma than in me by but it's not totally
8N0IZZpF8ts,912,00:16:27.870,00:16:27.880,than in me by but it's not totally
8N0IZZpF8ts,913,00:16:27.880,00:16:29.850,than in me by but it's not totally specific and part of the problem is that
8N0IZZpF8ts,914,00:16:29.850,00:16:29.860,specific and part of the problem is that
8N0IZZpF8ts,915,00:16:29.860,00:16:31.860,specific and part of the problem is that how do I know that that mitosis is in a
8N0IZZpF8ts,916,00:16:31.860,00:16:31.870,how do I know that that mitosis is in a
8N0IZZpF8ts,917,00:16:31.870,00:16:33.450,how do I know that that mitosis is in a melania site rather than a background
8N0IZZpF8ts,918,00:16:33.450,00:16:33.460,melania site rather than a background
8N0IZZpF8ts,919,00:16:33.460,00:16:35.490,melania site rather than a background keratinocyte because basal keratinocytes
8N0IZZpF8ts,920,00:16:35.490,00:16:35.500,keratinocyte because basal keratinocytes
8N0IZZpF8ts,921,00:16:35.500,00:16:37.860,keratinocyte because basal keratinocytes are supposed to divide and to divide a
8N0IZZpF8ts,922,00:16:37.860,00:16:37.870,are supposed to divide and to divide a
8N0IZZpF8ts,923,00:16:37.870,00:16:40.290,are supposed to divide and to divide a cell needs to have mitosis so just
8N0IZZpF8ts,924,00:16:40.290,00:16:40.300,cell needs to have mitosis so just
8N0IZZpF8ts,925,00:16:40.300,00:16:42.990,cell needs to have mitosis so just interpret mitosis in the epidermis with
8N0IZZpF8ts,926,00:16:42.990,00:16:43.000,interpret mitosis in the epidermis with
8N0IZZpF8ts,927,00:16:43.000,00:16:45.090,interpret mitosis in the epidermis with caution certainly if you start seeing a
8N0IZZpF8ts,928,00:16:45.090,00:16:45.100,caution certainly if you start seeing a
8N0IZZpF8ts,929,00:16:45.100,00:16:47.370,caution certainly if you start seeing a lot of them think about melanoma but
8N0IZZpF8ts,930,00:16:47.370,00:16:47.380,lot of them think about melanoma but
8N0IZZpF8ts,931,00:16:47.380,00:16:49.560,lot of them think about melanoma but don't let that be your sole feature that
8N0IZZpF8ts,932,00:16:49.560,00:16:49.570,don't let that be your sole feature that
8N0IZZpF8ts,933,00:16:49.570,00:16:51.000,don't let that be your sole feature that mean these very well may be in
8N0IZZpF8ts,934,00:16:51.000,00:16:51.010,mean these very well may be in
8N0IZZpF8ts,935,00:16:51.010,00:16:52.770,mean these very well may be in melanocytes but it's oftentimes
8N0IZZpF8ts,936,00:16:52.770,00:16:52.780,melanocytes but it's oftentimes
8N0IZZpF8ts,937,00:16:52.780,00:16:55.860,melanocytes but it's oftentimes difficult to tell for sure okay so if
8N0IZZpF8ts,938,00:16:55.860,00:16:55.870,difficult to tell for sure okay so if
8N0IZZpF8ts,939,00:16:55.870,00:16:57.390,difficult to tell for sure okay so if that's the only thing we're going you is
8N0IZZpF8ts,940,00:16:57.390,00:16:57.400,that's the only thing we're going you is
8N0IZZpF8ts,941,00:16:57.400,00:16:58.980,that's the only thing we're going you is that you've seen in mitosis in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,942,00:16:58.980,00:16:58.990,that you've seen in mitosis in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,943,00:16:58.990,00:17:00.600,that you've seen in mitosis in the epidermis and otherwise the lesion looks
8N0IZZpF8ts,944,00:17:00.600,00:17:00.610,epidermis and otherwise the lesion looks
8N0IZZpF8ts,945,00:17:00.610,00:17:02.640,epidermis and otherwise the lesion looks like a nevis stop and make sure that
8N0IZZpF8ts,946,00:17:02.640,00:17:02.650,like a nevis stop and make sure that
8N0IZZpF8ts,947,00:17:02.650,00:17:05.340,like a nevis stop and make sure that that's really in a melanocytes and and
8N0IZZpF8ts,948,00:17:05.340,00:17:05.350,that's really in a melanocytes and and
8N0IZZpF8ts,949,00:17:05.350,00:17:07.440,that's really in a melanocytes and and look at the other features but that by
8N0IZZpF8ts,950,00:17:07.440,00:17:07.450,look at the other features but that by
8N0IZZpF8ts,951,00:17:07.450,00:17:09.720,look at the other features but that by itself would not worry me too much in
8N0IZZpF8ts,952,00:17:09.720,00:17:09.730,itself would not worry me too much in
8N0IZZpF8ts,953,00:17:09.730,00:17:10.980,itself would not worry me too much in this case though obviously we have a
8N0IZZpF8ts,954,00:17:10.980,00:17:10.990,this case though obviously we have a
8N0IZZpF8ts,955,00:17:10.990,00:17:12.450,this case though obviously we have a tibia we have Patchett widespread
8N0IZZpF8ts,956,00:17:12.450,00:17:12.460,tibia we have Patchett widespread
8N0IZZpF8ts,957,00:17:12.460,00:17:14.340,tibia we have Patchett widespread asymmetry all of these other bad things
8N0IZZpF8ts,958,00:17:14.340,00:17:14.350,asymmetry all of these other bad things
8N0IZZpF8ts,959,00:17:14.350,00:17:17.250,asymmetry all of these other bad things and this is clearly a melanoma but when
8N0IZZpF8ts,960,00:17:17.250,00:17:17.260,and this is clearly a melanoma but when
8N0IZZpF8ts,961,00:17:17.260,00:17:19.590,and this is clearly a melanoma but when we're when we're counting mitosis for
8N0IZZpF8ts,962,00:17:19.590,00:17:19.600,we're when we're counting mitosis for
8N0IZZpF8ts,963,00:17:19.600,00:17:22.380,we're when we're counting mitosis for prognostic staging of melanomas we do
8N0IZZpF8ts,964,00:17:22.380,00:17:22.390,prognostic staging of melanomas we do
8N0IZZpF8ts,965,00:17:22.390,00:17:24.930,prognostic staging of melanomas we do not count them all the mitosis that are
8N0IZZpF8ts,966,00:17:24.930,00:17:24.940,not count them all the mitosis that are
8N0IZZpF8ts,967,00:17:24.940,00:17:26.850,not count them all the mitosis that are in the insight to component in the

8N0IZZpF8ts,969,00:17:26.860,00:17:29.100,in the insight to component in the epidermis we only count the mitosis that
8N0IZZpF8ts,970,00:17:29.100,00:17:29.110,epidermis we only count the mitosis that
8N0IZZpF8ts,971,00:17:29.110,00:17:31.890,epidermis we only count the mitosis that are in dermal invasive melanocytes okay
8N0IZZpF8ts,972,00:17:31.890,00:17:31.900,are in dermal invasive melanocytes okay
8N0IZZpF8ts,973,00:17:31.900,00:17:33.630,are in dermal invasive melanocytes okay and we'll talk more about that in a
8N0IZZpF8ts,974,00:17:33.630,00:17:33.640,and we'll talk more about that in a
8N0IZZpF8ts,975,00:17:33.640,00:17:36.810,and we'll talk more about that in a minute so anyway this is an example of a
8N0IZZpF8ts,976,00:17:36.810,00:17:36.820,minute so anyway this is an example of a
8N0IZZpF8ts,977,00:17:36.820,00:17:39.270,minute so anyway this is an example of a melanoma that shows marked cytologic
8N0IZZpF8ts,978,00:17:39.270,00:17:39.280,melanoma that shows marked cytologic
8N0IZZpF8ts,979,00:17:39.280,00:17:42.060,melanoma that shows marked cytologic atypia a unbelievable amount of patch

8N0IZZpF8ts,983,00:17:44.890,00:17:47.010,joint spread and asymmetry all of which are features of melanoma I would
8N0IZZpF8ts,984,00:17:47.010,00:17:47.020,are features of melanoma I would
8N0IZZpF8ts,985,00:17:47.020,00:17:47.769,are features of melanoma I would classified
8N0IZZpF8ts,986,00:17:47.769,00:17:47.779,classified
8N0IZZpF8ts,987,00:17:47.779,00:17:49.889,classified probably as a superficial spreading

8N0IZZpF8ts,989,00:17:49.899,00:17:52.749,probably as a superficial spreading melanoma so there historically are four
8N0IZZpF8ts,990,00:17:52.749,00:17:52.759,melanoma so there historically are four
8N0IZZpF8ts,991,00:17:52.759,00:17:54.909,melanoma so there historically are four major subtypes of melanoma superficial

8N0IZZpF8ts,1051,00:18:57.469,00:18:59.589,crawl into genus or or whatever so I usually will put those when I can when

8N0IZZpF8ts,1053,00:18:59.599,00:19:01.239,usually will put those when I can when I'm not sure of what subtype that I just
8N0IZZpF8ts,1054,00:19:01.239,00:19:01.249,I'm not sure of what subtype that I just
8N0IZZpF8ts,1055,00:19:01.249,00:19:03.159,I'm not sure of what subtype that I just say unclassified and that's just my
8N0IZZpF8ts,1056,00:19:03.159,00:19:03.169,say unclassified and that's just my
8N0IZZpF8ts,1057,00:19:03.169,00:19:04.769,say unclassified and that's just my personal approach to how I handle

8N0IZZpF8ts,1059,00:19:04.779,00:19:08.259,personal approach to how I handle melanoma diagnosis in my practice this
8N0IZZpF8ts,1060,00:19:08.259,00:19:08.269,melanoma diagnosis in my practice this
8N0IZZpF8ts,1061,00:19:08.269,00:19:10.989,melanoma diagnosis in my practice this is actually an acro lentigines melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,1062,00:19:10.989,00:19:10.999,is actually an acro lentigines melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,1063,00:19:10.999,00:19:13.930,is actually an acro lentigines melanoma and it is on acryl skin as you can see
8N0IZZpF8ts,1064,00:19:13.930,00:19:13.940,and it is on acryl skin as you can see
8N0IZZpF8ts,1065,00:19:13.940,00:19:17.979,and it is on acryl skin as you can see and this melanoma on acryl skin shows
8N0IZZpF8ts,1066,00:19:17.979,00:19:17.989,and this melanoma on acryl skin shows
8N0IZZpF8ts,1067,00:19:17.989,00:19:20.019,and this melanoma on acryl skin shows again a dramatic amount of Paget I'd
8N0IZZpF8ts,1068,00:19:20.019,00:19:20.029,again a dramatic amount of Paget I'd
8N0IZZpF8ts,1069,00:19:20.029,00:19:25.560,again a dramatic amount of Paget I'd spread okay lots of single melanocytes
8N0IZZpF8ts,1070,00:19:25.560,00:19:25.570,spread okay lots of single melanocytes
8N0IZZpF8ts,1071,00:19:25.570,00:19:28.149,spread okay lots of single melanocytes that are atypical and have kind of a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1072,00:19:28.149,00:19:28.159,that are atypical and have kind of a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1073,00:19:28.159,00:19:29.469,that are atypical and have kind of a grayish pink cytoplasm and they're
8N0IZZpF8ts,1074,00:19:29.469,00:19:29.479,grayish pink cytoplasm and they're
8N0IZZpF8ts,1075,00:19:29.479,00:19:31.149,grayish pink cytoplasm and they're spreading all the way up scattering all
8N0IZZpF8ts,1076,00:19:31.149,00:19:31.159,spreading all the way up scattering all
8N0IZZpF8ts,1077,00:19:31.159,00:19:34.509,spreading all the way up scattering all the way up into the even all the way up
8N0IZZpF8ts,1078,00:19:34.509,00:19:34.519,the way up into the even all the way up
8N0IZZpF8ts,1079,00:19:34.519,00:19:36.099,the way up into the even all the way up to the granule layer and into the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1080,00:19:36.099,00:19:36.109,to the granule layer and into the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1081,00:19:36.109,00:19:37.719,to the granule layer and into the corneal layer where they then die and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1082,00:19:37.719,00:19:37.729,corneal layer where they then die and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1083,00:19:37.729,00:19:39.969,corneal layer where they then die and get kind of trapped in the dead keratin
8N0IZZpF8ts,1084,00:19:39.969,00:19:39.979,get kind of trapped in the dead keratin
8N0IZZpF8ts,1085,00:19:39.979,00:19:41.560,get kind of trapped in the dead keratin and you can see that there are also some
8N0IZZpF8ts,1086,00:19:41.560,00:19:41.570,and you can see that there are also some
8N0IZZpF8ts,1087,00:19:41.570,00:19:43.450,and you can see that there are also some nests that are Paget I'd whole nests
8N0IZZpF8ts,1088,00:19:43.450,00:19:43.460,nests that are Paget I'd whole nests
8N0IZZpF8ts,1089,00:19:43.460,00:19:45.219,nests that are Paget I'd whole nests that are breaking free from the basal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1090,00:19:45.219,00:19:45.229,that are breaking free from the basal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1091,00:19:45.229,00:19:47.619,that are breaking free from the basal layer of the skin and spreading upwards
8N0IZZpF8ts,1092,00:19:47.619,00:19:47.629,layer of the skin and spreading upwards
8N0IZZpF8ts,1093,00:19:47.629,00:19:51.039,layer of the skin and spreading upwards into the epidermis okay so some people
8N0IZZpF8ts,1094,00:19:51.039,00:19:51.049,into the epidermis okay so some people
8N0IZZpF8ts,1095,00:19:51.049,00:19:52.690,into the epidermis okay so some people described this as a buckshot pattern
8N0IZZpF8ts,1096,00:19:52.690,00:19:52.700,described this as a buckshot pattern
8N0IZZpF8ts,1097,00:19:52.700,00:19:54.669,described this as a buckshot pattern also where it looks like a like a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1098,00:19:54.669,00:19:54.679,also where it looks like a like a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1099,00:19:54.679,00:19:57.009,also where it looks like a like a shotgun shot upwards into the epidermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,1100,00:19:57.009,00:19:57.019,shotgun shot upwards into the epidermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,1101,00:19:57.019,00:19:59.259,shotgun shot upwards into the epidermis and sprayed individual little pellets of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1102,00:19:59.259,00:19:59.269,and sprayed individual little pellets of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1103,00:19:59.269,00:20:00.450,and sprayed individual little pellets of buckshot into the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1104,00:20:00.450,00:20:00.460,buckshot into the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1105,00:20:00.460,00:20:03.120,buckshot into the epidermis okay so that's again dramatic
8N0IZZpF8ts,1106,00:20:03.120,00:20:03.130,epidermis okay so that's again dramatic
8N0IZZpF8ts,1107,00:20:03.130,00:20:04.770,epidermis okay so that's again dramatic patch toys spread remember that acryl
8N0IZZpF8ts,1108,00:20:04.770,00:20:04.780,patch toys spread remember that acryl
8N0IZZpF8ts,1109,00:20:04.780,00:20:06.570,patch toys spread remember that acryl NIMH I sometimes will have Paget

8N0IZZpF8ts,1111,00:20:06.580,00:20:08.130,NIMH I sometimes will have Paget widespread and occasionally it can even
8N0IZZpF8ts,1112,00:20:08.130,00:20:08.140,widespread and occasionally it can even
8N0IZZpF8ts,1113,00:20:08.140,00:20:10.170,widespread and occasionally it can even be pronounced but we see other things
8N0IZZpF8ts,1114,00:20:10.170,00:20:10.180,be pronounced but we see other things
8N0IZZpF8ts,1115,00:20:10.180,00:20:12.510,be pronounced but we see other things here this is very psychologically
8N0IZZpF8ts,1116,00:20:12.510,00:20:12.520,here this is very psychologically
8N0IZZpF8ts,1117,00:20:12.520,00:20:15.920,here this is very psychologically atypical we have really large nucleoli

8N0IZZpF8ts,1119,00:20:15.930,00:20:21.420,atypical we have really large nucleoli kind of that see if I can find it here
8N0IZZpF8ts,1120,00:20:21.420,00:20:21.430,kind of that see if I can find it here
8N0IZZpF8ts,1121,00:20:21.430,00:20:24.540,kind of that see if I can find it here we have large atypical nucleo nuclei

8N0IZZpF8ts,1125,00:20:26.650,00:20:28.650,with prominent nucleoli and look what we also have here's a nest that's actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,1126,00:20:28.650,00:20:28.660,also have here's a nest that's actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,1127,00:20:28.660,00:20:31.020,also have here's a nest that's actually down I think in the papillary dermis and

8N0IZZpF8ts,1131,00:20:32.620,00:20:35.310,look what we have right in the middle we have a mitosis so dermal my toesies are
8N0IZZpF8ts,1132,00:20:35.310,00:20:35.320,have a mitosis so dermal my toesies are
8N0IZZpF8ts,1133,00:20:35.320,00:20:37.560,have a mitosis so dermal my toesies are another worrisome finding in Malayan

8N0IZZpF8ts,1144,00:20:52.170,00:20:52.180,that look atypical and also particularly
8N0IZZpF8ts,1145,00:20:52.180,00:20:55.110,that look atypical and also particularly if you see mitosis in the deep aspect
8N0IZZpF8ts,1146,00:20:55.110,00:20:55.120,if you see mitosis in the deep aspect
8N0IZZpF8ts,1147,00:20:55.120,00:20:57.330,if you see mitosis in the deep aspect the down in the deep dermal portion of a

8N0IZZpF8ts,1161,00:21:12.490,00:21:14.730,multiple mitosis that's a time to stop and worry about melanoma particularly if
8N0IZZpF8ts,1162,00:21:14.730,00:21:14.740,and worry about melanoma particularly if
8N0IZZpF8ts,1163,00:21:14.740,00:21:17.070,and worry about melanoma particularly if you have a tibia Paget oh and spread
8N0IZZpF8ts,1164,00:21:17.070,00:21:17.080,you have a tibia Paget oh and spread
8N0IZZpF8ts,1165,00:21:17.080,00:21:18.660,you have a tibia Paget oh and spread other features if I have an atypical

8N0IZZpF8ts,1169,00:21:20.290,00:21:22.140,mole anesthetic lesion that I'm worried about melanoma and then I see a dermal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1170,00:21:22.140,00:21:22.150,about melanoma and then I see a dermal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1171,00:21:22.150,00:21:24.810,about melanoma and then I see a dermal mitosis that usually is kind of a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1172,00:21:24.810,00:21:24.820,mitosis that usually is kind of a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1173,00:21:24.820,00:21:26.280,mitosis that usually is kind of a feature that will push me over the edge
8N0IZZpF8ts,1174,00:21:26.280,00:21:26.290,feature that will push me over the edge
8N0IZZpF8ts,1175,00:21:26.290,00:21:28.320,feature that will push me over the edge into deciding yes this is melanoma if
8N0IZZpF8ts,1176,00:21:28.320,00:21:28.330,into deciding yes this is melanoma if
8N0IZZpF8ts,1177,00:21:28.330,00:21:30.870,into deciding yes this is melanoma if I'm on the line and uncertain having a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1178,00:21:30.870,00:21:30.880,I'm on the line and uncertain having a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1179,00:21:30.880,00:21:33.330,I'm on the line and uncertain having a mitosis in addition to other a typical
8N0IZZpF8ts,1180,00:21:33.330,00:21:33.340,mitosis in addition to other a typical
8N0IZZpF8ts,1181,00:21:33.340,00:21:35.760,mitosis in addition to other a typical features it's very helpful I mean
8N0IZZpF8ts,1182,00:21:35.760,00:21:35.770,features it's very helpful I mean
8N0IZZpF8ts,1183,00:21:35.770,00:21:37.410,features it's very helpful I mean obviously a case like this once you have
8N0IZZpF8ts,1184,00:21:37.410,00:21:37.420,obviously a case like this once you have
8N0IZZpF8ts,1185,00:21:37.420,00:21:39.180,obviously a case like this once you have some experience enduring path this from
8N0IZZpF8ts,1186,00:21:39.180,00:21:39.190,some experience enduring path this from
8N0IZZpF8ts,1187,00:21:39.190,00:21:40.530,some experience enduring path this from the second you put this slide on the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1188,00:21:40.530,00:21:40.540,the second you put this slide on the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1189,00:21:40.540,00:21:41.700,the second you put this slide on the scope you said this is going to be a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1190,00:21:41.700,00:21:41.710,scope you said this is going to be a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1191,00:21:41.710,00:21:44.370,scope you said this is going to be a melanoma it's a pretty easy really
8N0IZZpF8ts,1192,00:21:44.370,00:21:44.380,melanoma it's a pretty easy really
8N0IZZpF8ts,1193,00:21:44.380,00:21:48.240,melanoma it's a pretty easy really really classic dramatic example okay and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1194,00:21:48.240,00:21:48.250,really classic dramatic example okay and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1195,00:21:48.250,00:21:50.850,really classic dramatic example okay and here another thing we can look at this
8N0IZZpF8ts,1196,00:21:50.850,00:21:50.860,here another thing we can look at this
8N0IZZpF8ts,1197,00:21:50.860,00:21:53.780,here another thing we can look at this case and talk about is maturation okay
8N0IZZpF8ts,1198,00:21:53.780,00:21:53.790,case and talk about is maturation okay
8N0IZZpF8ts,1199,00:21:53.790,00:21:57.600,case and talk about is maturation okay maturation is somewhat of a complicated
8N0IZZpF8ts,1200,00:21:57.600,00:21:57.610,maturation is somewhat of a complicated
8N0IZZpF8ts,1201,00:21:57.610,00:22:00.030,maturation is somewhat of a complicated topic to talk about let's get at a lower
8N0IZZpF8ts,1202,00:22:00.030,00:22:00.040,topic to talk about let's get at a lower
8N0IZZpF8ts,1203,00:22:00.040,00:22:03.420,topic to talk about let's get at a lower power here what we generally see an even
8N0IZZpF8ts,1204,00:22:03.420,00:22:03.430,power here what we generally see an even
8N0IZZpF8ts,1205,00:22:03.430,00:22:05.220,power here what we generally see an even again go back to the nevis video if
8N0IZZpF8ts,1206,00:22:05.220,00:22:05.230,again go back to the nevis video if
8N0IZZpF8ts,1207,00:22:05.230,00:22:06.720,again go back to the nevis video if you've not watched it yet is we see that
8N0IZZpF8ts,1208,00:22:06.720,00:22:06.730,you've not watched it yet is we see that
8N0IZZpF8ts,1209,00:22:06.730,00:22:09.840,you've not watched it yet is we see that as when we have a metastatic lesion that
8N0IZZpF8ts,1210,00:22:09.840,00:22:09.850,as when we have a metastatic lesion that
8N0IZZpF8ts,1211,00:22:09.850,00:22:12.690,as when we have a metastatic lesion that has a dermal component either
8N0IZZpF8ts,1212,00:22:12.690,00:22:12.700,has a dermal component either
8N0IZZpF8ts,1213,00:22:12.700,00:22:14.940,has a dermal component either compound nevis or an intradermal nevis
8N0IZZpF8ts,1214,00:22:14.940,00:22:14.950,compound nevis or an intradermal nevis
8N0IZZpF8ts,1215,00:22:14.950,00:22:18.000,compound nevis or an intradermal nevis if we look at the melanocytes in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1216,00:22:18.000,00:22:18.010,if we look at the melanocytes in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1217,00:22:18.010,00:22:19.830,if we look at the melanocytes in the superficial dermis the papillary dermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,1218,00:22:19.830,00:22:19.840,superficial dermis the papillary dermis

8N0IZZpF8ts,1243,00:22:45.670,00:22:48.060,maturation or zonation some people say and this the term maturation goes all
8N0IZZpF8ts,1244,00:22:48.060,00:22:48.070,and this the term maturation goes all
8N0IZZpF8ts,1245,00:22:48.070,00:22:50.310,and this the term maturation goes all the way back to I believe dr. Oona in
8N0IZZpF8ts,1246,00:22:50.310,00:22:50.320,the way back to I believe dr. Oona in
8N0IZZpF8ts,1247,00:22:50.320,00:22:52.320,the way back to I believe dr. Oona in the eighteen late 1800s came up with
8N0IZZpF8ts,1248,00:22:52.320,00:22:52.330,the eighteen late 1800s came up with
8N0IZZpF8ts,1249,00:22:52.330,00:22:54.000,the eighteen late 1800s came up with this idea and the theory was that me buy
8N0IZZpF8ts,1250,00:22:54.000,00:22:54.010,this idea and the theory was that me buy
8N0IZZpF8ts,1251,00:22:54.010,00:22:55.830,this idea and the theory was that me buy starred as junctional things and then
8N0IZZpF8ts,1252,00:22:55.830,00:22:55.840,starred as junctional things and then
8N0IZZpF8ts,1253,00:22:55.840,00:22:58.380,starred as junctional things and then move down into the dermis and mature and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1254,00:22:58.380,00:22:58.390,move down into the dermis and mature and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1255,00:22:58.390,00:23:00.360,move down into the dermis and mature and we now I think biologically understand
8N0IZZpF8ts,1256,00:23:00.360,00:23:00.370,we now I think biologically understand
8N0IZZpF8ts,1257,00:23:00.370,00:23:01.560,we now I think biologically understand that that's not actually what's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1258,00:23:01.560,00:23:01.570,that that's not actually what's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1259,00:23:01.570,00:23:02.910,that that's not actually what's happening in niva but the term

8N0IZZpF8ts,1261,00:23:02.920,00:23:04.830,happening in niva but the term maturation is so widely used and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1262,00:23:04.830,00:23:04.840,maturation is so widely used and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1263,00:23:04.840,00:23:06.270,maturation is so widely used and understood in their path that we still
8N0IZZpF8ts,1264,00:23:06.270,00:23:06.280,understood in their path that we still
8N0IZZpF8ts,1265,00:23:06.280,00:23:08.070,understood in their path that we still use it even though it's probably not
8N0IZZpF8ts,1266,00:23:08.070,00:23:08.080,use it even though it's probably not
8N0IZZpF8ts,1267,00:23:08.080,00:23:09.840,use it even though it's probably not technically accurate at a scientific

8N0IZZpF8ts,1269,00:23:09.850,00:23:12.510,technically accurate at a scientific level okay but it certainly is a useful

8N0IZZpF8ts,1271,00:23:12.520,00:23:15.090,level okay but it certainly is a useful tool morphologically to determine if
8N0IZZpF8ts,1272,00:23:15.090,00:23:15.100,tool morphologically to determine if
8N0IZZpF8ts,1273,00:23:15.100,00:23:16.980,tool morphologically to determine if you're dealing with or to one of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1274,00:23:16.980,00:23:16.990,you're dealing with or to one of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1275,00:23:16.990,00:23:18.420,you're dealing with or to one of the points that you can use to determine if
8N0IZZpF8ts,1276,00:23:18.420,00:23:18.430,points that you can use to determine if
8N0IZZpF8ts,1277,00:23:18.430,00:23:19.590,points that you can use to determine if you're dealing with a melanoma or a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1278,00:23:19.590,00:23:19.600,you're dealing with a melanoma or a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1279,00:23:19.600,00:23:23.760,you're dealing with a melanoma or a nevis so at first glance this lesion may
8N0IZZpF8ts,1280,00:23:23.760,00:23:23.770,nevis so at first glance this lesion may
8N0IZZpF8ts,1281,00:23:23.770,00:23:25.170,nevis so at first glance this lesion may seem to have maturation
8N0IZZpF8ts,1282,00:23:25.170,00:23:25.180,seem to have maturation
8N0IZZpF8ts,1283,00:23:25.180,00:23:27.510,seem to have maturation it's got large nests of large cells up
8N0IZZpF8ts,1284,00:23:27.510,00:23:27.520,it's got large nests of large cells up
8N0IZZpF8ts,1285,00:23:27.520,00:23:29.790,it's got large nests of large cells up here and as you go deeper the nests and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1286,00:23:29.790,00:23:29.800,here and as you go deeper the nests and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1287,00:23:29.800,00:23:30.930,here and as you go deeper the nests and the cells seem to get a little bit
8N0IZZpF8ts,1288,00:23:30.930,00:23:30.940,the cells seem to get a little bit
8N0IZZpF8ts,1289,00:23:30.940,00:23:33.210,the cells seem to get a little bit smaller so this is again why maturation
8N0IZZpF8ts,1290,00:23:33.210,00:23:33.220,smaller so this is again why maturation
8N0IZZpF8ts,1291,00:23:33.220,00:23:34.620,smaller so this is again why maturation even though we find it useful it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1292,00:23:34.620,00:23:34.630,even though we find it useful it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1293,00:23:34.630,00:23:36.110,even though we find it useful it's sometimes kind of complicated because
8N0IZZpF8ts,1294,00:23:36.110,00:23:36.120,sometimes kind of complicated because
8N0IZZpF8ts,1295,00:23:36.120,00:23:38.340,sometimes kind of complicated because it's not as easy to evaluate
8N0IZZpF8ts,1296,00:23:38.340,00:23:38.350,it's not as easy to evaluate
8N0IZZpF8ts,1297,00:23:38.350,00:23:41.100,it's not as easy to evaluate particularly for beginning pathologists
8N0IZZpF8ts,1298,00:23:41.100,00:23:41.110,particularly for beginning pathologists
8N0IZZpF8ts,1299,00:23:41.110,00:23:42.960,particularly for beginning pathologists but I'll tell you one thing that I find
8N0IZZpF8ts,1300,00:23:42.960,00:23:42.970,but I'll tell you one thing that I find
8N0IZZpF8ts,1301,00:23:42.970,00:23:45.780,but I'll tell you one thing that I find really helpful is obviously if you see
8N0IZZpF8ts,1302,00:23:45.780,00:23:45.790,really helpful is obviously if you see
8N0IZZpF8ts,1303,00:23:45.790,00:23:47.700,really helpful is obviously if you see large nests of large cells down to the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1304,00:23:47.700,00:23:47.710,large nests of large cells down to the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1305,00:23:47.710,00:23:49.890,large nests of large cells down to the deep part of a lesion that is one
8N0IZZpF8ts,1306,00:23:49.890,00:23:49.900,deep part of a lesion that is one
8N0IZZpF8ts,1307,00:23:49.900,00:23:51.780,deep part of a lesion that is one feature that might be worrisome for
8N0IZZpF8ts,1308,00:23:51.780,00:23:51.790,feature that might be worrisome for
8N0IZZpF8ts,1309,00:23:51.790,00:23:53.610,feature that might be worrisome for melanoma and I'll go look closer for
8N0IZZpF8ts,1310,00:23:53.610,00:23:53.620,melanoma and I'll go look closer for
8N0IZZpF8ts,1311,00:23:53.620,00:23:55.320,melanoma and I'll go look closer for other things but what we can see here
8N0IZZpF8ts,1312,00:23:55.320,00:23:55.330,other things but what we can see here
8N0IZZpF8ts,1313,00:23:55.330,00:23:57.540,other things but what we can see here this again is obvious there's cytologic
8N0IZZpF8ts,1314,00:23:57.540,00:23:57.550,this again is obvious there's cytologic
8N0IZZpF8ts,1315,00:23:57.550,00:23:59.880,this again is obvious there's cytologic atypia very atypical melanocytes here
8N0IZZpF8ts,1316,00:23:59.880,00:23:59.890,atypia very atypical melanocytes here
8N0IZZpF8ts,1317,00:23:59.890,00:24:02.850,atypia very atypical melanocytes here they're large they have kind of hyper
8N0IZZpF8ts,1318,00:24:02.850,00:24:02.860,they're large they have kind of hyper
8N0IZZpF8ts,1319,00:24:02.860,00:24:05.520,they're large they have kind of hyper cremation some of them we see mitotic
8N0IZZpF8ts,1320,00:24:05.520,00:24:05.530,cremation some of them we see mitotic
8N0IZZpF8ts,1321,00:24:05.530,00:24:08.220,cremation some of them we see mitotic figures multiple layers of mitosis over
8N0IZZpF8ts,1322,00:24:08.220,00:24:08.230,figures multiple layers of mitosis over
8N0IZZpF8ts,1323,00:24:08.230,00:24:12.240,figures multiple layers of mitosis over here but look as we go down even though
8N0IZZpF8ts,1324,00:24:12.240,00:24:12.250,here but look as we go down even though
8N0IZZpF8ts,1325,00:24:12.250,00:24:14.070,here but look as we go down even though the nest gets smaller the melanocytes
8N0IZZpF8ts,1326,00:24:14.070,00:24:14.080,the nest gets smaller the melanocytes
8N0IZZpF8ts,1327,00:24:14.080,00:24:16.050,the nest gets smaller the melanocytes are still very large and atypical and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1328,00:24:16.050,00:24:16.060,are still very large and atypical and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1329,00:24:16.060,00:24:18.210,are still very large and atypical and they have nuclei even down here at the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1330,00:24:18.210,00:24:18.220,they have nuclei even down here at the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1331,00:24:18.220,00:24:20.160,they have nuclei even down here at the deep part I feel like that's one helpful
8N0IZZpF8ts,1332,00:24:20.160,00:24:20.170,deep part I feel like that's one helpful
8N0IZZpF8ts,1333,00:24:20.170,00:24:22.020,deep part I feel like that's one helpful thing if I have a lesion that looks kind
8N0IZZpF8ts,1334,00:24:22.020,00:24:22.030,thing if I have a lesion that looks kind
8N0IZZpF8ts,1335,00:24:22.030,00:24:23.910,thing if I have a lesion that looks kind of funny and I look down at the deepest
8N0IZZpF8ts,1336,00:24:23.910,00:24:23.920,of funny and I look down at the deepest
8N0IZZpF8ts,1337,00:24:23.920,00:24:26.100,of funny and I look down at the deepest portion of the lesion deepest portion of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1338,00:24:26.100,00:24:26.110,portion of the lesion deepest portion of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1339,00:24:26.110,00:24:26.640,portion of the lesion deepest portion of the milena
8N0IZZpF8ts,1340,00:24:26.640,00:24:26.650,the milena
8N0IZZpF8ts,1341,00:24:26.650,00:24:29.550,the milena a lesion in the deep dermis or deeper
8N0IZZpF8ts,1342,00:24:29.550,00:24:29.560,a lesion in the deep dermis or deeper
8N0IZZpF8ts,1343,00:24:29.560,00:24:31.200,a lesion in the deep dermis or deeper down in the dermis and look at the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1344,00:24:31.200,00:24:31.210,down in the dermis and look at the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1345,00:24:31.210,00:24:33.420,down in the dermis and look at the nuclei if the nuclei are still large and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1346,00:24:33.420,00:24:33.430,nuclei if the nuclei are still large and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1347,00:24:33.430,00:24:35.220,nuclei if the nuclei are still large and there are still prominent nucleoli even
8N0IZZpF8ts,1348,00:24:35.220,00:24:35.230,there are still prominent nucleoli even
8N0IZZpF8ts,1349,00:24:35.230,00:24:37.200,there are still prominent nucleoli even down deep to me that's a sign that maybe
8N0IZZpF8ts,1350,00:24:37.200,00:24:37.210,down deep to me that's a sign that maybe
8N0IZZpF8ts,1351,00:24:37.210,00:24:38.430,down deep to me that's a sign that maybe the lesion doesn't have normal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1352,00:24:38.430,00:24:38.440,the lesion doesn't have normal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1353,00:24:38.440,00:24:41.100,the lesion doesn't have normal maturation so even though it does seem
8N0IZZpF8ts,1354,00:24:41.100,00:24:41.110,maturation so even though it does seem
8N0IZZpF8ts,1355,00:24:41.110,00:24:42.510,maturation so even though it does seem to get a little the cells get a little
8N0IZZpF8ts,1356,00:24:42.510,00:24:42.520,to get a little the cells get a little
8N0IZZpF8ts,1357,00:24:42.520,00:24:44.430,to get a little the cells get a little smaller and the nests get smaller we
8N0IZZpF8ts,1358,00:24:44.430,00:24:44.440,smaller and the nests get smaller we
8N0IZZpF8ts,1359,00:24:44.440,00:24:46.290,smaller and the nests get smaller we still have pretty atypical cells and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1360,00:24:46.290,00:24:46.300,still have pretty atypical cells and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1361,00:24:46.300,00:24:48.300,still have pretty atypical cells and pretty large cells down here at the deep
8N0IZZpF8ts,1362,00:24:48.300,00:24:48.310,pretty large cells down here at the deep
8N0IZZpF8ts,1363,00:24:48.310,00:24:50.760,pretty large cells down here at the deep aspect of the lesion and also you may
8N0IZZpF8ts,1364,00:24:50.760,00:24:50.770,aspect of the lesion and also you may
8N0IZZpF8ts,1365,00:24:50.770,00:24:52.080,aspect of the lesion and also you may have noticed we passed over a couple
8N0IZZpF8ts,1366,00:24:52.080,00:24:52.090,have noticed we passed over a couple
8N0IZZpF8ts,1367,00:24:52.090,00:24:54.210,have noticed we passed over a couple mitosis here's one right here again so
8N0IZZpF8ts,1368,00:24:54.210,00:24:54.220,mitosis here's one right here again so
8N0IZZpF8ts,1369,00:24:54.220,00:24:56.340,mitosis here's one right here again so we have multiple dermal mitosis in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1370,00:24:56.340,00:24:56.350,we have multiple dermal mitosis in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1371,00:24:56.350,00:24:58.830,we have multiple dermal mitosis in the dermal melanocytes in this case and it
8N0IZZpF8ts,1372,00:24:58.830,00:24:58.840,dermal melanocytes in this case and it
8N0IZZpF8ts,1373,00:24:58.840,00:25:00.270,dermal melanocytes in this case and it can also be a little challenging
8N0IZZpF8ts,1374,00:25:00.270,00:25:00.280,can also be a little challenging
8N0IZZpF8ts,1375,00:25:00.280,00:25:01.770,can also be a little challenging sometimes to tell if the dermal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1376,00:25:01.770,00:25:01.780,sometimes to tell if the dermal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1377,00:25:01.780,00:25:03.510,sometimes to tell if the dermal melanocytes are I'm sorry the dermal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1378,00:25:03.510,00:25:03.520,melanocytes are I'm sorry the dermal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1379,00:25:03.520,00:25:05.460,melanocytes are I'm sorry the dermal mitosis are actually in melanocytes or
8N0IZZpF8ts,1380,00:25:05.460,00:25:05.470,mitosis are actually in melanocytes or
8N0IZZpF8ts,1381,00:25:05.470,00:25:07.140,mitosis are actually in melanocytes or not if you see you know sometimes
8N0IZZpF8ts,1382,00:25:07.140,00:25:07.150,not if you see you know sometimes
8N0IZZpF8ts,1383,00:25:07.150,00:25:09.420,not if you see you know sometimes mitosis will if there's a lot of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1384,00:25:09.420,00:25:09.430,mitosis will if there's a lot of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1385,00:25:09.430,00:25:11.100,mitosis will if there's a lot of inflammation you can see mitotic figures
8N0IZZpF8ts,1386,00:25:11.100,00:25:11.110,inflammation you can see mitotic figures
8N0IZZpF8ts,1387,00:25:11.110,00:25:14.340,inflammation you can see mitotic figures in the inflammatory cells or in dividing
8N0IZZpF8ts,1388,00:25:14.340,00:25:14.350,in the inflammatory cells or in dividing
8N0IZZpF8ts,1389,00:25:14.350,00:25:15.660,in the inflammatory cells or in dividing endothelial cells if there's some
8N0IZZpF8ts,1390,00:25:15.660,00:25:15.670,endothelial cells if there's some
8N0IZZpF8ts,1391,00:25:15.670,00:25:17.730,endothelial cells if there's some granulation tissue or reactive vessels
8N0IZZpF8ts,1392,00:25:17.730,00:25:17.740,granulation tissue or reactive vessels
8N0IZZpF8ts,1393,00:25:17.740,00:25:19.710,granulation tissue or reactive vessels around but here when you see a mitosis
8N0IZZpF8ts,1394,00:25:19.710,00:25:19.720,around but here when you see a mitosis
8N0IZZpF8ts,1395,00:25:19.720,00:25:21.210,around but here when you see a mitosis that's right in the middle of a nest of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1396,00:25:21.210,00:25:21.220,that's right in the middle of a nest of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1397,00:25:21.220,00:25:23.190,that's right in the middle of a nest of melanocytes there's no doubt about that
8N0IZZpF8ts,1398,00:25:23.190,00:25:23.200,melanocytes there's no doubt about that
8N0IZZpF8ts,1399,00:25:23.200,00:25:26.250,melanocytes there's no doubt about that that's a mitosis in a dermal melanocytes
8N0IZZpF8ts,1400,00:25:26.250,00:25:26.260,that's a mitosis in a dermal melanocytes
8N0IZZpF8ts,1401,00:25:26.260,00:25:28.710,that's a mitosis in a dermal melanocytes and that is a very worrisome sign for
8N0IZZpF8ts,1402,00:25:28.710,00:25:28.720,and that is a very worrisome sign for
8N0IZZpF8ts,1403,00:25:28.720,00:25:31.080,and that is a very worrisome sign for melanoma when there are many of them and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1404,00:25:31.080,00:25:31.090,melanoma when there are many of them and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1405,00:25:31.090,00:25:32.490,melanoma when there are many of them and when there are other atypical features
8N0IZZpF8ts,1406,00:25:32.490,00:25:32.500,when there are other atypical features
8N0IZZpF8ts,1407,00:25:32.500,00:25:34.710,when there are other atypical features present so again here we are down at the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1408,00:25:34.710,00:25:34.720,present so again here we are down at the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1409,00:25:34.720,00:25:36.540,present so again here we are down at the deepest aspect of the lesion and as we
8N0IZZpF8ts,1410,00:25:36.540,00:25:36.550,deepest aspect of the lesion and as we
8N0IZZpF8ts,1411,00:25:36.550,00:25:39.050,deepest aspect of the lesion and as we look along we still see pretty large
8N0IZZpF8ts,1412,00:25:39.050,00:25:39.060,look along we still see pretty large
8N0IZZpF8ts,1413,00:25:39.060,00:25:41.820,look along we still see pretty large very atypical cells even down here at
8N0IZZpF8ts,1414,00:25:41.820,00:25:41.830,very atypical cells even down here at
8N0IZZpF8ts,1415,00:25:41.830,00:25:44.010,very atypical cells even down here at the deep aspect and I think here's an
8N0IZZpF8ts,1416,00:25:44.010,00:25:44.020,the deep aspect and I think here's an
8N0IZZpF8ts,1417,00:25:44.020,00:25:46.170,the deep aspect and I think here's an area where I thought somewhere on here
8N0IZZpF8ts,1418,00:25:46.170,00:25:46.180,area where I thought somewhere on here
8N0IZZpF8ts,1419,00:25:46.180,00:25:51.240,area where I thought somewhere on here there was a good area that yeah here's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1420,00:25:51.240,00:25:51.250,there was a good area that yeah here's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1421,00:25:51.250,00:25:53.100,there was a good area that yeah here's an area I think that's helpful to see
8N0IZZpF8ts,1422,00:25:53.100,00:25:53.110,an area I think that's helpful to see
8N0IZZpF8ts,1423,00:25:53.110,00:25:55.230,an area I think that's helpful to see this looking in the papillary dermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,1424,00:25:55.230,00:25:55.240,this looking in the papillary dermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,1425,00:25:55.240,00:25:57.210,this looking in the papillary dermis here we see large nests of large cells
8N0IZZpF8ts,1426,00:25:57.210,00:25:57.220,here we see large nests of large cells
8N0IZZpF8ts,1427,00:25:57.220,00:25:59.550,here we see large nests of large cells and as we go down they still tend to be
8N0IZZpF8ts,1428,00:25:59.550,00:25:59.560,and as we go down they still tend to be
8N0IZZpF8ts,1429,00:25:59.560,00:26:01.860,and as we go down they still tend to be pretty large even as we move down into
8N0IZZpF8ts,1430,00:26:01.860,00:26:01.870,pretty large even as we move down into
8N0IZZpF8ts,1431,00:26:01.870,00:26:03.960,pretty large even as we move down into the dermis still large cells still large
8N0IZZpF8ts,1432,00:26:03.960,00:26:03.970,the dermis still large cells still large
8N0IZZpF8ts,1433,00:26:03.970,00:26:05.970,the dermis still large cells still large nests they do start to trickle out down
8N0IZZpF8ts,1434,00:26:05.970,00:26:05.980,nests they do start to trickle out down
8N0IZZpF8ts,1435,00:26:05.980,00:26:07.560,nests they do start to trickle out down here and again that could give you the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1436,00:26:07.560,00:26:07.570,here and again that could give you the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1437,00:26:07.570,00:26:08.820,here and again that could give you the impression that there's normal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1438,00:26:08.820,00:26:08.830,impression that there's normal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1439,00:26:08.830,00:26:11.790,impression that there's normal maturation at low power but at higher
8N0IZZpF8ts,1440,00:26:11.790,00:26:11.800,maturation at low power but at higher
8N0IZZpF8ts,1441,00:26:11.800,00:26:18.410,maturation at low power but at higher power these cells are clearly a typical
8N0IZZpF8ts,1442,00:26:23.370,00:26:23.380,big nucleoli large nuclei a typical
8N0IZZpF8ts,1443,00:26:23.380,00:26:25.590,big nucleoli large nuclei a typical nuclei even down at the deep aspect of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1444,00:26:25.590,00:26:25.600,nuclei even down at the deep aspect of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1445,00:26:25.600,00:26:28.200,nuclei even down at the deep aspect of the lesion so maturation is a helpful
8N0IZZpF8ts,1446,00:26:28.200,00:26:28.210,the lesion so maturation is a helpful
8N0IZZpF8ts,1447,00:26:28.210,00:26:30.240,the lesion so maturation is a helpful feature but it only works on lesions
8N0IZZpF8ts,1448,00:26:30.240,00:26:30.250,feature but it only works on lesions
8N0IZZpF8ts,1449,00:26:30.250,00:26:32.190,feature but it only works on lesions where you have a dermal component of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1450,00:26:32.190,00:26:32.200,where you have a dermal component of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1451,00:26:32.200,00:26:34.230,where you have a dermal component of melanocytes you can't use that the word
8N0IZZpF8ts,1452,00:26:34.230,00:26:34.240,melanocytes you can't use that the word
8N0IZZpF8ts,1453,00:26:34.240,00:26:35.780,melanocytes you can't use that the word maturation when you're talking about
8N0IZZpF8ts,1454,00:26:35.780,00:26:35.790,maturation when you're talking about
8N0IZZpF8ts,1455,00:26:35.790,00:26:38.310,maturation when you're talking about junctional nevis versus melanoma insight
8N0IZZpF8ts,1456,00:26:38.310,00:26:38.320,junctional nevis versus melanoma insight
8N0IZZpF8ts,1457,00:26:38.320,00:26:40.590,junctional nevis versus melanoma insight okay so in those kinds of cases you only
8N0IZZpF8ts,1458,00:26:40.590,00:26:40.600,okay so in those kinds of cases you only
8N0IZZpF8ts,1459,00:26:40.600,00:26:42.509,okay so in those kinds of cases you only can look at the epidermal features the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1460,00:26:42.509,00:26:42.519,can look at the epidermal features the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1461,00:26:42.519,00:26:44.580,can look at the epidermal features the features that that Milan aesthetic
8N0IZZpF8ts,1462,00:26:44.580,00:26:44.590,features that that Milan aesthetic
8N0IZZpF8ts,1463,00:26:44.590,00:26:47.460,features that that Milan aesthetic lesions have in the epidermis maturation
8N0IZZpF8ts,1464,00:26:47.460,00:26:47.470,lesions have in the epidermis maturation
8N0IZZpF8ts,1465,00:26:47.470,00:26:49.379,lesions have in the epidermis maturation only works if there's a dermal component
8N0IZZpF8ts,1466,00:26:49.379,00:26:49.389,only works if there's a dermal component
8N0IZZpF8ts,1467,00:26:49.389,00:26:51.960,only works if there's a dermal component okay so you can't use that rule when
8N0IZZpF8ts,1468,00:26:51.960,00:26:51.970,okay so you can't use that rule when
8N0IZZpF8ts,1469,00:26:51.970,00:26:53.129,okay so you can't use that rule when you're trying to decide something to
8N0IZZpF8ts,1470,00:26:53.129,00:26:53.139,you're trying to decide something to
8N0IZZpF8ts,1471,00:26:53.139,00:26:54.509,you're trying to decide something to melanoma in sites who or nothing all
8N0IZZpF8ts,1472,00:26:54.509,00:26:54.519,melanoma in sites who or nothing all
8N0IZZpF8ts,1473,00:26:54.519,00:26:59.190,melanoma in sites who or nothing all right so that's another example of a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1474,00:26:59.190,00:26:59.200,right so that's another example of a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1475,00:26:59.200,00:27:02.430,right so that's another example of a tibia of Paget I spread and of abnormal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1476,00:27:02.430,00:27:02.440,tibia of Paget I spread and of abnormal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1477,00:27:02.440,00:27:11.580,tibia of Paget I spread and of abnormal maturation in a melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,1478,00:27:18.820,00:27:18.830,now here's a scar this is a dermal scar
8N0IZZpF8ts,1479,00:27:18.830,00:27:21.160,now here's a scar this is a dermal scar and the reason is that this is a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1480,00:27:21.160,00:27:21.170,and the reason is that this is a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1481,00:27:21.170,00:27:23.410,and the reason is that this is a melanoma that was biopsied and then the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1482,00:27:23.410,00:27:23.420,melanoma that was biopsied and then the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1483,00:27:23.420,00:27:26.560,melanoma that was biopsied and then the margins were positive and and they came
8N0IZZpF8ts,1484,00:27:26.560,00:27:26.570,margins were positive and and they came
8N0IZZpF8ts,1485,00:27:26.570,00:27:28.510,margins were positive and and they came back and they did a wide local excision
8N0IZZpF8ts,1486,00:27:28.510,00:27:28.520,back and they did a wide local excision
8N0IZZpF8ts,1487,00:27:28.520,00:27:31.420,back and they did a wide local excision around it and here's the residual
8N0IZZpF8ts,1488,00:27:31.420,00:27:31.430,around it and here's the residual
8N0IZZpF8ts,1489,00:27:31.430,00:27:33.760,around it and here's the residual melanoma that's left over here and again
8N0IZZpF8ts,1490,00:27:33.760,00:27:33.770,melanoma that's left over here and again
8N0IZZpF8ts,1491,00:27:33.770,00:27:35.260,melanoma that's left over here and again this is just an example of really
8N0IZZpF8ts,1492,00:27:35.260,00:27:35.270,this is just an example of really
8N0IZZpF8ts,1493,00:27:35.270,00:27:38.020,this is just an example of really dramatic Paget would spread with lots of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1494,00:27:38.020,00:27:38.030,dramatic Paget would spread with lots of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1495,00:27:38.030,00:27:41.020,dramatic Paget would spread with lots of atypical melanocytes scattering upwards
8N0IZZpF8ts,1496,00:27:41.020,00:27:41.030,atypical melanocytes scattering upwards
8N0IZZpF8ts,1497,00:27:41.030,00:27:43.750,atypical melanocytes scattering upwards into the superficial aspect of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1498,00:27:43.750,00:27:43.760,into the superficial aspect of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1499,00:27:43.760,00:27:46.600,into the superficial aspect of the epidermis and this is in this melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,1500,00:27:46.600,00:27:46.610,epidermis and this is in this melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,1501,00:27:46.610,00:27:48.250,epidermis and this is in this melanoma doesn't have much pigment at all right
8N0IZZpF8ts,1502,00:27:48.250,00:27:48.260,doesn't have much pigment at all right
8N0IZZpF8ts,1503,00:27:48.260,00:27:50.770,doesn't have much pigment at all right the cells are very pale grayish
8N0IZZpF8ts,1504,00:27:50.770,00:27:50.780,the cells are very pale grayish
8N0IZZpF8ts,1505,00:27:50.780,00:27:53.140,the cells are very pale grayish cytoplasm and this is a little bit older
8N0IZZpF8ts,1506,00:27:53.140,00:27:53.150,cytoplasm and this is a little bit older
8N0IZZpF8ts,1507,00:27:53.150,00:27:55.480,cytoplasm and this is a little bit older slide that's a touch faded but still you
8N0IZZpF8ts,1508,00:27:55.480,00:27:55.490,slide that's a touch faded but still you
8N0IZZpF8ts,1509,00:27:55.490,00:27:57.370,slide that's a touch faded but still you can tell that there's really no melanin
8N0IZZpF8ts,1510,00:27:57.370,00:27:57.380,can tell that there's really no melanin
8N0IZZpF8ts,1511,00:27:57.380,00:28:00.250,can tell that there's really no melanin pigment production here okay so when the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1512,00:28:00.250,00:28:00.260,pigment production here okay so when the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1513,00:28:00.260,00:28:02.890,pigment production here okay so when the melanin pigment is present it's helpful
8N0IZZpF8ts,1514,00:28:02.890,00:28:02.900,melanin pigment is present it's helpful
8N0IZZpF8ts,1515,00:28:02.900,00:28:04.690,melanin pigment is present it's helpful and actually even though I've just said
8N0IZZpF8ts,1516,00:28:04.690,00:28:04.700,and actually even though I've just said
8N0IZZpF8ts,1517,00:28:04.700,00:28:07.090,and actually even though I've just said that now I've been proven wrong when you
8N0IZZpF8ts,1518,00:28:07.090,00:28:07.100,that now I've been proven wrong when you
8N0IZZpF8ts,1519,00:28:07.100,00:28:08.410,that now I've been proven wrong when you look really close I don't know if it'll
8N0IZZpF8ts,1520,00:28:08.410,00:28:08.420,look really close I don't know if it'll
8N0IZZpF8ts,1521,00:28:08.420,00:28:09.550,look really close I don't know if it'll pick up on the video there are actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,1522,00:28:09.550,00:28:09.560,pick up on the video there are actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,1523,00:28:09.560,00:28:12.100,pick up on the video there are actually really tiny little little bits and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1524,00:28:12.100,00:28:12.110,really tiny little little bits and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1525,00:28:12.110,00:28:14.080,really tiny little little bits and pieces of melanin in some of these cells
8N0IZZpF8ts,1526,00:28:14.080,00:28:14.090,pieces of melanin in some of these cells
8N0IZZpF8ts,1527,00:28:14.090,00:28:18.520,pieces of melanin in some of these cells very subtle and focal and if you have
8N0IZZpF8ts,1528,00:28:18.520,00:28:18.530,very subtle and focal and if you have
8N0IZZpF8ts,1529,00:28:18.530,00:28:21.010,very subtle and focal and if you have doubts in a case like this and you're
8N0IZZpF8ts,1530,00:28:21.010,00:28:21.020,doubts in a case like this and you're
8N0IZZpF8ts,1531,00:28:21.020,00:28:23.140,doubts in a case like this and you're not sure if these are melanocytes or not
8N0IZZpF8ts,1532,00:28:23.140,00:28:23.150,not sure if these are melanocytes or not
8N0IZZpF8ts,1533,00:28:23.150,00:28:24.790,not sure if these are melanocytes or not you know it's Padgett I'd you know it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1534,00:28:24.790,00:28:24.800,you know it's Padgett I'd you know it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1535,00:28:24.800,00:28:26.770,you know it's Padgett I'd you know it's a typical you know it must be malignant
8N0IZZpF8ts,1536,00:28:26.770,00:28:26.780,a typical you know it must be malignant
8N0IZZpF8ts,1537,00:28:26.780,00:28:28.330,a typical you know it must be malignant but you're not sure are these
8N0IZZpF8ts,1538,00:28:28.330,00:28:28.340,but you're not sure are these
8N0IZZpF8ts,1539,00:28:28.340,00:28:30.310,but you're not sure are these melanocytes or could this be Patras
8N0IZZpF8ts,1540,00:28:30.310,00:28:30.320,melanocytes or could this be Patras
8N0IZZpF8ts,1541,00:28:30.320,00:28:32.230,melanocytes or could this be Patras disease could this be screaming site - I
8N0IZZpF8ts,1542,00:28:32.230,00:28:32.240,disease could this be screaming site - I
8N0IZZpF8ts,1543,00:28:32.240,00:28:34.450,disease could this be screaming site - I think much much of the time you can
8N0IZZpF8ts,1544,00:28:34.450,00:28:34.460,think much much of the time you can
8N0IZZpF8ts,1545,00:28:34.460,00:28:36.550,think much much of the time you can decide that on H and E alone but when
8N0IZZpF8ts,1546,00:28:36.550,00:28:36.560,decide that on H and E alone but when
8N0IZZpF8ts,1547,00:28:36.560,00:28:38.560,decide that on H and E alone but when you need help you can use Melania setec
8N0IZZpF8ts,1548,00:28:38.560,00:28:38.570,you need help you can use Melania setec
8N0IZZpF8ts,1549,00:28:38.570,00:28:40.240,you need help you can use Melania setec markers to help sort out that
8N0IZZpF8ts,1550,00:28:40.240,00:28:40.250,markers to help sort out that
8N0IZZpF8ts,1551,00:28:40.250,00:28:43.330,markers to help sort out that differential so mark one or sox10 will
8N0IZZpF8ts,1552,00:28:43.330,00:28:43.340,differential so mark one or sox10 will
8N0IZZpF8ts,1553,00:28:43.340,00:28:45.340,differential so mark one or sox10 will stay in the melanocytes but will be
8N0IZZpF8ts,1554,00:28:45.340,00:28:45.350,stay in the melanocytes but will be
8N0IZZpF8ts,1555,00:28:45.350,00:28:48.010,stay in the melanocytes but will be negative in Paget or squamous cell
8N0IZZpF8ts,1556,00:28:48.010,00:28:48.020,negative in Paget or squamous cell
8N0IZZpF8ts,1557,00:28:48.020,00:28:49.870,negative in Paget or squamous cell carcinoma in situ and in Paget's disease
8N0IZZpF8ts,1558,00:28:49.870,00:28:49.880,carcinoma in situ and in Paget's disease
8N0IZZpF8ts,1559,00:28:49.880,00:28:52.660,carcinoma in situ and in Paget's disease of the nipple or extra memory patches
8N0IZZpF8ts,1560,00:28:52.660,00:28:52.670,of the nipple or extra memory patches
8N0IZZpF8ts,1561,00:28:52.670,00:28:54.490,of the nipple or extra memory patches disease so you can use a variety of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1562,00:28:54.490,00:28:54.500,disease so you can use a variety of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1563,00:28:54.500,00:28:56.500,disease so you can use a variety of different immuno stains to help you here
8N0IZZpF8ts,1564,00:28:56.500,00:28:56.510,different immuno stains to help you here
8N0IZZpF8ts,1565,00:28:56.510,00:28:58.120,different immuno stains to help you here again is a nice example of nuclear
8N0IZZpF8ts,1566,00:28:58.120,00:28:58.130,again is a nice example of nuclear
8N0IZZpF8ts,1567,00:28:58.130,00:28:59.980,again is a nice example of nuclear atypia with a really large Melina site
8N0IZZpF8ts,1568,00:28:59.980,00:28:59.990,atypia with a really large Melina site
8N0IZZpF8ts,1569,00:28:59.990,00:29:03.940,atypia with a really large Melina site with a huge nucleolus and then that's a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1570,00:29:03.940,00:29:03.950,with a huge nucleolus and then that's a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1571,00:29:03.950,00:29:08.460,with a huge nucleolus and then that's a nice example of Paget widespread
8N0IZZpF8ts,1572,00:29:11.320,00:29:11.330,so this is another another example of a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1573,00:29:11.330,00:29:13.720,so this is another another example of a superficial spreading pattern of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1574,00:29:13.720,00:29:13.730,superficial spreading pattern of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1575,00:29:13.730,00:29:15.730,superficial spreading pattern of melanoma in this case is actually just
8N0IZZpF8ts,1576,00:29:15.730,00:29:15.740,melanoma in this case is actually just
8N0IZZpF8ts,1577,00:29:15.740,00:29:20.499,melanoma in this case is actually just melanoma in situ and most of the time
8N0IZZpF8ts,1578,00:29:20.499,00:29:20.509,melanoma in situ and most of the time
8N0IZZpF8ts,1579,00:29:20.509,00:29:21.909,melanoma in situ and most of the time for melanoma insight to I just say
8N0IZZpF8ts,1580,00:29:21.909,00:29:21.919,for melanoma insight to I just say
8N0IZZpF8ts,1581,00:29:21.919,00:29:23.350,for melanoma insight to I just say melanoma in situ and I don't actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,1582,00:29:23.350,00:29:23.360,melanoma in situ and I don't actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,1583,00:29:23.360,00:29:25.779,melanoma in situ and I don't actually put down a subtype with the exception of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1584,00:29:25.779,00:29:25.789,put down a subtype with the exception of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1585,00:29:25.789,00:29:28.330,put down a subtype with the exception of the lent to go malignus subtype because
8N0IZZpF8ts,1586,00:29:28.330,00:29:28.340,the lent to go malignus subtype because
8N0IZZpF8ts,1587,00:29:28.340,00:29:30.100,the lent to go malignus subtype because those do tend to spread farther to the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1588,00:29:30.100,00:29:30.110,those do tend to spread farther to the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1589,00:29:30.110,00:29:32.169,those do tend to spread farther to the side and oftentimes require a wider
8N0IZZpF8ts,1590,00:29:32.169,00:29:32.179,side and oftentimes require a wider
8N0IZZpF8ts,1591,00:29:32.179,00:29:34.840,side and oftentimes require a wider margin or more stages on Mohs surgery if
8N0IZZpF8ts,1592,00:29:34.840,00:29:34.850,margin or more stages on Mohs surgery if
8N0IZZpF8ts,1593,00:29:34.850,00:29:37.029,margin or more stages on Mohs surgery if Moses being used and so I think a lot of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1594,00:29:37.029,00:29:37.039,Moses being used and so I think a lot of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1595,00:29:37.039,00:29:39.159,Moses being used and so I think a lot of times the the treating physicians like
8N0IZZpF8ts,1596,00:29:39.159,00:29:39.169,times the the treating physicians like
8N0IZZpF8ts,1597,00:29:39.169,00:29:40.869,times the the treating physicians like to know that information so when I have
8N0IZZpF8ts,1598,00:29:40.869,00:29:40.879,to know that information so when I have
8N0IZZpF8ts,1599,00:29:40.879,00:29:42.399,to know that information so when I have leant to go malignant even on a melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,1600,00:29:42.399,00:29:42.409,leant to go malignant even on a melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,1601,00:29:42.409,00:29:45.029,leant to go malignant even on a melanoma insight you I do tend to say that I
8N0IZZpF8ts,1602,00:29:45.029,00:29:45.039,insight you I do tend to say that I
8N0IZZpF8ts,1603,00:29:45.039,00:29:48.100,insight you I do tend to say that I think and that's just my my personal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1604,00:29:48.100,00:29:48.110,think and that's just my my personal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1605,00:29:48.110,00:29:57.330,think and that's just my my personal practice
8N0IZZpF8ts,1606,00:30:00.600,00:30:00.610,all right so here's another example of a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1607,00:30:00.610,00:30:03.450,all right so here's another example of a melanoma natural skin and this this
8N0IZZpF8ts,1608,00:30:03.450,00:30:03.460,melanoma natural skin and this this
8N0IZZpF8ts,1609,00:30:03.460,00:30:04.980,melanoma natural skin and this this really dark stuff here by the way this
8N0IZZpF8ts,1610,00:30:04.980,00:30:04.990,really dark stuff here by the way this
8N0IZZpF8ts,1611,00:30:04.990,00:30:07.110,really dark stuff here by the way this is just an air air bubble underneath the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1612,00:30:07.110,00:30:07.120,is just an air air bubble underneath the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1613,00:30:07.120,00:30:08.520,is just an air air bubble underneath the slide that's right on top of the carrots
8N0IZZpF8ts,1614,00:30:08.520,00:30:08.530,slide that's right on top of the carrots
8N0IZZpF8ts,1615,00:30:08.530,00:30:10.140,slide that's right on top of the carrots insights it's not important so if you're
8N0IZZpF8ts,1616,00:30:10.140,00:30:10.150,insights it's not important so if you're
8N0IZZpF8ts,1617,00:30:10.150,00:30:11.820,insights it's not important so if you're if you're a beginner watching this just
8N0IZZpF8ts,1618,00:30:11.820,00:30:11.830,if you're a beginner watching this just
8N0IZZpF8ts,1619,00:30:11.830,00:30:13.140,if you're a beginner watching this just know that's all that is if you see that
8N0IZZpF8ts,1620,00:30:13.140,00:30:13.150,know that's all that is if you see that
8N0IZZpF8ts,1621,00:30:13.150,00:30:15.540,know that's all that is if you see that real dark line it's not not melanin this
8N0IZZpF8ts,1622,00:30:15.540,00:30:15.550,real dark line it's not not melanin this
8N0IZZpF8ts,1623,00:30:15.550,00:30:17.340,real dark line it's not not melanin this stuff the dark stuff you're seeing here
8N0IZZpF8ts,1624,00:30:17.340,00:30:17.350,stuff the dark stuff you're seeing here
8N0IZZpF8ts,1625,00:30:17.350,00:30:19.800,stuff the dark stuff you're seeing here that's actually melanin okay so here's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1626,00:30:19.800,00:30:19.810,that's actually melanin okay so here's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1627,00:30:19.810,00:30:22.490,that's actually melanin okay so here's an acro lesion a large acro lesion on
8N0IZZpF8ts,1628,00:30:22.490,00:30:22.500,an acro lesion a large acro lesion on
8N0IZZpF8ts,1629,00:30:22.500,00:30:28.890,an acro lesion a large acro lesion on the sole of the foot okay well we can
8N0IZZpF8ts,1630,00:30:28.890,00:30:28.900,the sole of the foot okay well we can
8N0IZZpF8ts,1631,00:30:28.900,00:30:30.390,the sole of the foot okay well we can see right here actually in the dermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,1632,00:30:30.390,00:30:30.400,see right here actually in the dermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,1633,00:30:30.400,00:30:34.860,see right here actually in the dermis there's a nevis here so this knee this
8N0IZZpF8ts,1634,00:30:34.860,00:30:34.870,there's a nevis here so this knee this
8N0IZZpF8ts,1635,00:30:34.870,00:30:36.330,there's a nevis here so this knee this has probably been present for a long
8N0IZZpF8ts,1636,00:30:36.330,00:30:36.340,has probably been present for a long
8N0IZZpF8ts,1637,00:30:36.340,00:30:39.180,has probably been present for a long time all of these cells in the dermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,1638,00:30:39.180,00:30:39.190,time all of these cells in the dermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,1639,00:30:39.190,00:30:41.250,time all of these cells in the dermis they're they're maturing nicely they're
8N0IZZpF8ts,1640,00:30:41.250,00:30:41.260,they're they're maturing nicely they're
8N0IZZpF8ts,1641,00:30:41.260,00:30:43.230,they're they're maturing nicely they're starting up here and then going down a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1642,00:30:43.230,00:30:43.240,starting up here and then going down a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1643,00:30:43.240,00:30:46.470,starting up here and then going down a maturing and getting smaller but in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1644,00:30:46.470,00:30:46.480,maturing and getting smaller but in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1645,00:30:46.480,00:30:48.930,maturing and getting smaller but in the epidermis we see something else going on
8N0IZZpF8ts,1646,00:30:48.930,00:30:48.940,epidermis we see something else going on
8N0IZZpF8ts,1647,00:30:48.940,00:30:50.610,epidermis we see something else going on we see some Paget widespread which you
8N0IZZpF8ts,1648,00:30:50.610,00:30:50.620,we see some Paget widespread which you
8N0IZZpF8ts,1649,00:30:50.620,00:30:52.650,we see some Paget widespread which you can have in a crow Levi but we also see
8N0IZZpF8ts,1650,00:30:52.650,00:30:52.660,can have in a crow Levi but we also see
8N0IZZpF8ts,1651,00:30:52.660,00:30:54.750,can have in a crow Levi but we also see pretty large atypical melanocytes here
8N0IZZpF8ts,1652,00:30:54.750,00:30:54.760,pretty large atypical melanocytes here
8N0IZZpF8ts,1653,00:30:54.760,00:30:58.860,pretty large atypical melanocytes here and in acryl sites what I like to see to
8N0IZZpF8ts,1654,00:30:58.860,00:30:58.870,and in acryl sites what I like to see to
8N0IZZpF8ts,1655,00:30:58.870,00:31:00.390,and in acryl sites what I like to see to make a diagnosis of a crawl and TJ's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1656,00:31:00.390,00:31:00.400,make a diagnosis of a crawl and TJ's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1657,00:31:00.400,00:31:02.760,make a diagnosis of a crawl and TJ's melanoma ideally I like to see severe
8N0IZZpF8ts,1658,00:31:02.760,00:31:02.770,melanoma ideally I like to see severe
8N0IZZpF8ts,1659,00:31:02.770,00:31:05.580,melanoma ideally I like to see severe cytologic atypia and confluent growth
8N0IZZpF8ts,1660,00:31:05.580,00:31:05.590,cytologic atypia and confluent growth
8N0IZZpF8ts,1661,00:31:05.590,00:31:07.140,cytologic atypia and confluent growth now we don't always get that and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1662,00:31:07.140,00:31:07.150,now we don't always get that and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1663,00:31:07.150,00:31:09.960,now we don't always get that and sometimes the edges of a large acryl

8N0IZZpF8ts,1667,00:31:11.680,00:31:14.220,intentionally Noma if they biopsy near the edge it can sometimes be very subtle
8N0IZZpF8ts,1668,00:31:14.220,00:31:14.230,the edge it can sometimes be very subtle
8N0IZZpF8ts,1669,00:31:14.230,00:31:16.380,the edge it can sometimes be very subtle and so this is why on acryl pigmented
8N0IZZpF8ts,1670,00:31:16.380,00:31:16.390,and so this is why on acryl pigmented
8N0IZZpF8ts,1671,00:31:16.390,00:31:18.030,and so this is why on acryl pigmented lesions I really like to know the size
8N0IZZpF8ts,1672,00:31:18.030,00:31:18.040,lesions I really like to know the size
8N0IZZpF8ts,1673,00:31:18.040,00:31:20.250,lesions I really like to know the size of the lesion if they're biopsy a really
8N0IZZpF8ts,1674,00:31:20.250,00:31:20.260,of the lesion if they're biopsy a really
8N0IZZpF8ts,1675,00:31:20.260,00:31:22.440,of the lesion if they're biopsy a really tiny lesion and the biopsy probably is
8N0IZZpF8ts,1676,00:31:22.440,00:31:22.450,tiny lesion and the biopsy probably is
8N0IZZpF8ts,1677,00:31:22.450,00:31:25.320,tiny lesion and the biopsy probably is showing most of of what of the lesion
8N0IZZpF8ts,1678,00:31:25.320,00:31:25.330,showing most of of what of the lesion
8N0IZZpF8ts,1679,00:31:25.330,00:31:27.930,showing most of of what of the lesion clinically you know it's lesions three
8N0IZZpF8ts,1680,00:31:27.930,00:31:27.940,clinically you know it's lesions three
8N0IZZpF8ts,1681,00:31:27.940,00:31:29.280,clinically you know it's lesions three or four millimeters and they've done a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1682,00:31:29.280,00:31:29.290,or four millimeters and they've done a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1683,00:31:29.290,00:31:31.170,or four millimeters and they've done a shave biopsy or a punch biopsy well in
8N0IZZpF8ts,1684,00:31:31.170,00:31:31.180,shave biopsy or a punch biopsy well in
8N0IZZpF8ts,1685,00:31:31.180,00:31:33.690,shave biopsy or a punch biopsy well in that case then I feel pretty reassured
8N0IZZpF8ts,1686,00:31:33.690,00:31:33.700,that case then I feel pretty reassured
8N0IZZpF8ts,1687,00:31:33.700,00:31:35.400,that case then I feel pretty reassured that what I'm dealing was probably not a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1688,00:31:35.400,00:31:35.410,that what I'm dealing was probably not a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1689,00:31:35.410,00:31:37.050,that what I'm dealing was probably not a melanoma it's not that you cannot have
8N0IZZpF8ts,1690,00:31:37.050,00:31:37.060,melanoma it's not that you cannot have
8N0IZZpF8ts,1691,00:31:37.060,00:31:39.270,melanoma it's not that you cannot have small melanomas you can but on acryl
8N0IZZpF8ts,1692,00:31:39.270,00:31:39.280,small melanomas you can but on acryl
8N0IZZpF8ts,1693,00:31:39.280,00:31:41.700,small melanomas you can but on acryl skin the thing that worries me is that
8N0IZZpF8ts,1694,00:31:41.700,00:31:41.710,skin the thing that worries me is that
8N0IZZpF8ts,1695,00:31:41.710,00:31:43.260,skin the thing that worries me is that I'm getting a small biopsy of a large
8N0IZZpF8ts,1696,00:31:43.260,00:31:43.270,I'm getting a small biopsy of a large
8N0IZZpF8ts,1697,00:31:43.270,00:31:44.250,I'm getting a small biopsy of a large lesion so if you're a dermatologist

8N0IZZpF8ts,1735,00:32:21.220,00:32:23.160,from a potential misdiagnosis okay so on a crawl on a chrome will an aesthetic
8N0IZZpF8ts,1736,00:32:23.160,00:32:23.170,a crawl on a chrome will an aesthetic
8N0IZZpF8ts,1737,00:32:23.170,00:32:24.960,a crawl on a chrome will an aesthetic things I like to know the size and make
8N0IZZpF8ts,1738,00:32:24.960,00:32:24.970,things I like to know the size and make
8N0IZZpF8ts,1739,00:32:24.970,00:32:26.910,things I like to know the size and make sure I'm not missing something in any
8N0IZZpF8ts,1740,00:32:26.910,00:32:26.920,sure I'm not missing something in any
8N0IZZpF8ts,1741,00:32:26.920,00:32:28.440,sure I'm not missing something in any case this is a big excision because this
8N0IZZpF8ts,1742,00:32:28.440,00:32:28.450,case this is a big excision because this
8N0IZZpF8ts,1743,00:32:28.450,00:32:30.390,case this is a big excision because this was already a biopsy proven melanoma so
8N0IZZpF8ts,1744,00:32:30.390,00:32:30.400,was already a biopsy proven melanoma so
8N0IZZpF8ts,1745,00:32:30.400,00:32:32.010,was already a biopsy proven melanoma so there was Nevis there but there's also
8N0IZZpF8ts,1746,00:32:32.010,00:32:32.020,there was Nevis there but there's also
8N0IZZpF8ts,1747,00:32:32.020,00:32:35.310,there was Nevis there but there's also melanoma melanomas arise in neve i on a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1748,00:32:35.310,00:32:35.320,melanoma melanomas arise in neve i on a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1749,00:32:35.320,00:32:37.530,melanoma melanomas arise in neve i on a relatively regular basis i mean the risk
8N0IZZpF8ts,1750,00:32:37.530,00:32:37.540,relatively regular basis i mean the risk
8N0IZZpF8ts,1751,00:32:37.540,00:32:38.970,relatively regular basis i mean the risk of a Nevis turning the melanoma is very
8N0IZZpF8ts,1752,00:32:38.970,00:32:38.980,of a Nevis turning the melanoma is very
8N0IZZpF8ts,1753,00:32:38.980,00:32:41.100,of a Nevis turning the melanoma is very low people most people have multiple
8N0IZZpF8ts,1754,00:32:41.100,00:32:41.110,low people most people have multiple
8N0IZZpF8ts,1755,00:32:41.110,00:32:43.230,low people most people have multiple Niva and most people do not ever get
8N0IZZpF8ts,1756,00:32:43.230,00:32:43.240,Niva and most people do not ever get
8N0IZZpF8ts,1757,00:32:43.240,00:32:45.510,Niva and most people do not ever get melanoma so the risk is low but we do
8N0IZZpF8ts,1758,00:32:45.510,00:32:45.520,melanoma so the risk is low but we do
8N0IZZpF8ts,1759,00:32:45.520,00:32:47.670,melanoma so the risk is low but we do see melanoma next to neve i on a regular
8N0IZZpF8ts,1760,00:32:47.670,00:32:47.680,see melanoma next to neve i on a regular
8N0IZZpF8ts,1761,00:32:47.680,00:32:50.850,see melanoma next to neve i on a regular basis in my practice okay the reason I'm
8N0IZZpF8ts,1762,00:32:50.850,00:32:50.860,basis in my practice okay the reason I'm
8N0IZZpF8ts,1763,00:32:50.860,00:32:52.410,basis in my practice okay the reason I'm showing this is the acryl intense
8N0IZZpF8ts,1764,00:32:52.410,00:32:52.420,showing this is the acryl intense
8N0IZZpF8ts,1765,00:32:52.420,00:32:55.140,showing this is the acryl intense melanoma is the best type of melanoma to
8N0IZZpF8ts,1766,00:32:55.140,00:32:55.150,melanoma is the best type of melanoma to
8N0IZZpF8ts,1767,00:32:55.150,00:32:58.110,melanoma is the best type of melanoma to show confluent growth okay so confluent
8N0IZZpF8ts,1768,00:32:58.110,00:32:58.120,show confluent growth okay so confluent
8N0IZZpF8ts,1769,00:32:58.120,00:33:01.170,show confluent growth okay so confluent growth is a feature that we look at as
8N0IZZpF8ts,1770,00:33:01.170,00:33:01.180,growth is a feature that we look at as
8N0IZZpF8ts,1771,00:33:01.180,00:33:03.570,growth is a feature that we look at as worrisome animal an aesthetic lesion
8N0IZZpF8ts,1772,00:33:03.570,00:33:03.580,worrisome animal an aesthetic lesion
8N0IZZpF8ts,1773,00:33:03.580,00:33:06.360,worrisome animal an aesthetic lesion niba usually have individual either
8N0IZZpF8ts,1774,00:33:06.360,00:33:06.370,niba usually have individual either
8N0IZZpF8ts,1775,00:33:06.370,00:33:08.370,niba usually have individual either either nests or sometimes single
8N0IZZpF8ts,1776,00:33:08.370,00:33:08.380,either nests or sometimes single
8N0IZZpF8ts,1777,00:33:08.380,00:33:11.160,either nests or sometimes single melanocytes in the epidermal junction at
8N0IZZpF8ts,1778,00:33:11.160,00:33:11.170,melanocytes in the epidermal junction at
8N0IZZpF8ts,1779,00:33:11.170,00:33:12.630,melanocytes in the epidermal junction at the dirt of the basal layer but they're
8N0IZZpF8ts,1780,00:33:12.630,00:33:12.640,the dirt of the basal layer but they're
8N0IZZpF8ts,1781,00:33:12.640,00:33:14.880,the dirt of the basal layer but they're spaced out from one another by normal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1782,00:33:14.880,00:33:14.890,spaced out from one another by normal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1783,00:33:14.890,00:33:16.650,spaced out from one another by normal intervening keratinocytes okay that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1784,00:33:16.650,00:33:16.660,intervening keratinocytes okay that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1785,00:33:16.660,00:33:18.060,intervening keratinocytes okay that's the way normal melanocytes grow and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1786,00:33:18.060,00:33:18.070,the way normal melanocytes grow and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1787,00:33:18.070,00:33:19.400,the way normal melanocytes grow and that's the way Neve I tend to grow
8N0IZZpF8ts,1788,00:33:19.400,00:33:19.410,that's the way Neve I tend to grow
8N0IZZpF8ts,1789,00:33:19.410,00:33:22.290,that's the way Neve I tend to grow melanoma sometimes though will grow over
8N0IZZpF8ts,1790,00:33:22.290,00:33:22.300,melanoma sometimes though will grow over
8N0IZZpF8ts,1791,00:33:22.300,00:33:24.030,melanoma sometimes though will grow over grow in the epidermis and sometimes they
8N0IZZpF8ts,1792,00:33:24.030,00:33:24.040,grow in the epidermis and sometimes they
8N0IZZpF8ts,1793,00:33:24.040,00:33:25.680,grow in the epidermis and sometimes they spread upwards and that's Paget joy
8N0IZZpF8ts,1794,00:33:25.680,00:33:25.690,spread upwards and that's Paget joy
8N0IZZpF8ts,1795,00:33:25.690,00:33:27.510,spread upwards and that's Paget joy spread and sometimes they spread out to
8N0IZZpF8ts,1796,00:33:27.510,00:33:27.520,spread and sometimes they spread out to
8N0IZZpF8ts,1797,00:33:27.520,00:33:29.940,spread and sometimes they spread out to the sides and replace the basal layer
8N0IZZpF8ts,1798,00:33:29.940,00:33:29.950,the sides and replace the basal layer
8N0IZZpF8ts,1799,00:33:29.950,00:33:31.950,the sides and replace the basal layer with melanocytes they push the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1800,00:33:31.950,00:33:31.960,with melanocytes they push the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1801,00:33:31.960,00:33:33.540,with melanocytes they push the keratinocytes out of the way and we call
8N0IZZpF8ts,1802,00:33:33.540,00:33:33.550,keratinocytes out of the way and we call
8N0IZZpF8ts,1803,00:33:33.550,00:33:40.500,keratinocytes out of the way and we call that confluence or conflagration
8N0IZZpF8ts,1804,00:33:42.630,00:33:42.640,it can be kind of challenging to
8N0IZZpF8ts,1805,00:33:42.640,00:33:45.330,it can be kind of challenging to evaluate microscopically it's easy for
8N0IZZpF8ts,1806,00:33:45.330,00:33:45.340,evaluate microscopically it's easy for
8N0IZZpF8ts,1807,00:33:45.340,00:33:46.680,evaluate microscopically it's easy for us enduring path to talk about that
8N0IZZpF8ts,1808,00:33:46.680,00:33:46.690,us enduring path to talk about that
8N0IZZpF8ts,1809,00:33:46.690,00:33:47.940,us enduring path to talk about that feature but it's actually kind of hard I
8N0IZZpF8ts,1810,00:33:47.940,00:33:47.950,feature but it's actually kind of hard I
8N0IZZpF8ts,1811,00:33:47.950,00:33:49.380,feature but it's actually kind of hard I think to pick up on how to how to
8N0IZZpF8ts,1812,00:33:49.380,00:33:49.390,think to pick up on how to how to
8N0IZZpF8ts,1813,00:33:49.390,00:33:51.450,think to pick up on how to how to diagnose it so I think that acro
8N0IZZpF8ts,1814,00:33:51.450,00:33:51.460,diagnose it so I think that acro
8N0IZZpF8ts,1815,00:33:51.460,00:33:53.430,diagnose it so I think that acro melanomas are usually show really
8N0IZZpF8ts,1816,00:33:53.430,00:33:53.440,melanomas are usually show really
8N0IZZpF8ts,1817,00:33:53.440,00:33:55.710,melanomas are usually show really dramatic confluent growth and so they're
8N0IZZpF8ts,1818,00:33:55.710,00:33:55.720,dramatic confluent growth and so they're
8N0IZZpF8ts,1819,00:33:55.720,00:33:57.000,dramatic confluent growth and so they're a good place to start when we're talking
8N0IZZpF8ts,1820,00:33:57.000,00:33:57.010,a good place to start when we're talking
8N0IZZpF8ts,1821,00:33:57.010,00:33:59.700,a good place to start when we're talking about this pattern okay so here and this
8N0IZZpF8ts,1822,00:33:59.700,00:33:59.710,about this pattern okay so here and this
8N0IZZpF8ts,1823,00:33:59.710,00:34:01.470,about this pattern okay so here and this again I told you earlier that usually
8N0IZZpF8ts,1824,00:34:01.470,00:34:01.480,again I told you earlier that usually
8N0IZZpF8ts,1825,00:34:01.480,00:34:02.790,again I told you earlier that usually they're really darkly pigmented cells
8N0IZZpF8ts,1826,00:34:02.790,00:34:02.800,they're really darkly pigmented cells
8N0IZZpF8ts,1827,00:34:02.800,00:34:05.280,they're really darkly pigmented cells are not melanocytes well here's me being
8N0IZZpF8ts,1828,00:34:05.280,00:34:05.290,are not melanocytes well here's me being
8N0IZZpF8ts,1829,00:34:05.290,00:34:07.230,are not melanocytes well here's me being proven wrong sometimes they are I feel
8N0IZZpF8ts,1830,00:34:07.230,00:34:07.240,proven wrong sometimes they are I feel
8N0IZZpF8ts,1831,00:34:07.240,00:34:08.909,proven wrong sometimes they are I feel like acryl melanomas have a tendency to
8N0IZZpF8ts,1832,00:34:08.909,00:34:08.919,like acryl melanomas have a tendency to
8N0IZZpF8ts,1833,00:34:08.919,00:34:10.409,like acryl melanomas have a tendency to have more pigment I don't know if that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1834,00:34:10.409,00:34:10.419,have more pigment I don't know if that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1835,00:34:10.419,00:34:12.180,have more pigment I don't know if that's really true but in my experience they
8N0IZZpF8ts,1836,00:34:12.180,00:34:12.190,really true but in my experience they
8N0IZZpF8ts,1837,00:34:12.190,00:34:13.889,really true but in my experience they seem to up more often be darkly
8N0IZZpF8ts,1838,00:34:13.889,00:34:13.899,seem to up more often be darkly
8N0IZZpF8ts,1839,00:34:13.899,00:34:16.620,seem to up more often be darkly pigmented melanocytes then than other
8N0IZZpF8ts,1840,00:34:16.620,00:34:16.630,pigmented melanocytes then than other
8N0IZZpF8ts,1841,00:34:16.630,00:34:18.419,pigmented melanocytes then than other types of melanomas so up here we have
8N0IZZpF8ts,1842,00:34:18.419,00:34:18.429,types of melanomas so up here we have
8N0IZZpF8ts,1843,00:34:18.429,00:34:20.760,types of melanomas so up here we have some Paget or cells and along the basal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1844,00:34:20.760,00:34:20.770,some Paget or cells and along the basal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1845,00:34:20.770,00:34:22.200,some Paget or cells and along the basal layer here these guys even though they
8N0IZZpF8ts,1846,00:34:22.200,00:34:22.210,layer here these guys even though they
8N0IZZpF8ts,1847,00:34:22.210,00:34:23.760,layer here these guys even though they have a lot of pigment these are actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,1848,00:34:23.760,00:34:23.770,have a lot of pigment these are actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,1849,00:34:23.770,00:34:23.980,have a lot of pigment these are actually all
8N0IZZpF8ts,1850,00:34:23.980,00:34:23.990,all
8N0IZZpF8ts,1851,00:34:23.990,00:34:25.840,all melanocytes and if you did a stain for
8N0IZZpF8ts,1852,00:34:25.840,00:34:25.850,melanocytes and if you did a stain for
8N0IZZpF8ts,1853,00:34:25.850,00:34:28.510,melanocytes and if you did a stain for Mart one or Sox ten they'd almost all be
8N0IZZpF8ts,1854,00:34:28.510,00:34:28.520,Mart one or Sox ten they'd almost all be
8N0IZZpF8ts,1855,00:34:28.520,00:34:29.889,Mart one or Sox ten they'd almost all be positive and they've basically
8N0IZZpF8ts,1856,00:34:29.889,00:34:29.899,positive and they've basically
8N0IZZpF8ts,1857,00:34:29.899,00:34:33.340,positive and they've basically completely replaced the basal layer like
8N0IZZpF8ts,1858,00:34:33.340,00:34:33.350,completely replaced the basal layer like
8N0IZZpF8ts,1859,00:34:33.350,00:34:35.500,completely replaced the basal layer like there are almost no keratinocytes left
8N0IZZpF8ts,1860,00:34:35.500,00:34:35.510,there are almost no keratinocytes left
8N0IZZpF8ts,1861,00:34:35.510,00:34:37.450,there are almost no keratinocytes left in here all you see are melanocytes with
8N0IZZpF8ts,1862,00:34:37.450,00:34:37.460,in here all you see are melanocytes with
8N0IZZpF8ts,1863,00:34:37.460,00:34:39.070,in here all you see are melanocytes with very maybe there's a rare keratinocyte
8N0IZZpF8ts,1864,00:34:39.070,00:34:39.080,very maybe there's a rare keratinocyte
8N0IZZpF8ts,1865,00:34:39.080,00:34:41.530,very maybe there's a rare keratinocyte left in here but almost the entire basal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1866,00:34:41.530,00:34:41.540,left in here but almost the entire basal
8N0IZZpF8ts,1867,00:34:41.540,00:34:43.840,left in here but almost the entire basal layer is replaced by atypical
8N0IZZpF8ts,1868,00:34:43.840,00:34:43.850,layer is replaced by atypical
8N0IZZpF8ts,1869,00:34:43.850,00:34:45.220,layer is replaced by atypical melanocytes that's called confluent
8N0IZZpF8ts,1870,00:34:45.220,00:34:45.230,melanocytes that's called confluent
8N0IZZpF8ts,1871,00:34:45.230,00:34:47.409,melanocytes that's called confluent growth and that's a worrisome sign for
8N0IZZpF8ts,1872,00:34:47.409,00:34:47.419,growth and that's a worrisome sign for
8N0IZZpF8ts,1873,00:34:47.419,00:34:49.780,growth and that's a worrisome sign for melanoma particularly if it's really
8N0IZZpF8ts,1874,00:34:49.780,00:34:49.790,melanoma particularly if it's really
8N0IZZpF8ts,1875,00:34:49.790,00:34:52.000,melanoma particularly if it's really prominent sometimes an irritated nieve
8N0IZZpF8ts,1876,00:34:52.000,00:34:52.010,prominent sometimes an irritated nieve
8N0IZZpF8ts,1877,00:34:52.010,00:34:53.710,prominent sometimes an irritated nieve eye or particularly Nev eye that have
8N0IZZpF8ts,1878,00:34:53.710,00:34:53.720,eye or particularly Nev eye that have
8N0IZZpF8ts,1879,00:34:53.720,00:34:56.409,eye or particularly Nev eye that have been biopsied and then re grown over top
8N0IZZpF8ts,1880,00:34:56.409,00:34:56.419,been biopsied and then re grown over top
8N0IZZpF8ts,1881,00:34:56.419,00:35:00.070,been biopsied and then re grown over top of the scar recurrent Nev eye they can
8N0IZZpF8ts,1882,00:35:00.070,00:35:00.080,of the scar recurrent Nev eye they can
8N0IZZpF8ts,1883,00:35:00.080,00:35:02.200,of the scar recurrent Nev eye they can have pretty striking confluent growth
8N0IZZpF8ts,1884,00:35:02.200,00:35:02.210,have pretty striking confluent growth
8N0IZZpF8ts,1885,00:35:02.210,00:35:04.540,have pretty striking confluent growth and yet are still benign so again every
8N0IZZpF8ts,1886,00:35:04.540,00:35:04.550,and yet are still benign so again every
8N0IZZpF8ts,1887,00:35:04.550,00:35:06.220,and yet are still benign so again every single rule I'm going to teach you here
8N0IZZpF8ts,1888,00:35:06.220,00:35:06.230,single rule I'm going to teach you here
8N0IZZpF8ts,1889,00:35:06.230,00:35:08.590,single rule I'm going to teach you here today is going to have possible times
8N0IZZpF8ts,1890,00:35:08.590,00:35:08.600,today is going to have possible times
8N0IZZpF8ts,1891,00:35:08.600,00:35:10.900,today is going to have possible times when it can be broken okay so recurrent
8N0IZZpF8ts,1892,00:35:10.900,00:35:10.910,when it can be broken okay so recurrent
8N0IZZpF8ts,1893,00:35:10.910,00:35:13.930,when it can be broken okay so recurrent Nev I can look and also really irritated
8N0IZZpF8ts,1894,00:35:13.930,00:35:13.940,Nev I can look and also really irritated
8N0IZZpF8ts,1895,00:35:13.940,00:35:15.700,Nev I can look and also really irritated or scratched excoriated and Eve eye that
8N0IZZpF8ts,1896,00:35:15.700,00:35:15.710,or scratched excoriated and Eve eye that
8N0IZZpF8ts,1897,00:35:15.710,00:35:18.730,or scratched excoriated and Eve eye that have regrown into the epidermis over top
8N0IZZpF8ts,1898,00:35:18.730,00:35:18.740,have regrown into the epidermis over top
8N0IZZpF8ts,1899,00:35:18.740,00:35:20.890,have regrown into the epidermis over top of the area of injury they can have what
8N0IZZpF8ts,1900,00:35:20.890,00:35:20.900,of the area of injury they can have what
8N0IZZpF8ts,1901,00:35:20.900,00:35:22.900,of the area of injury they can have what looks like confluent but a confluent
8N0IZZpF8ts,1902,00:35:22.900,00:35:22.910,looks like confluent but a confluent
8N0IZZpF8ts,1903,00:35:22.910,00:35:24.850,looks like confluent but a confluent growth but here we have mark cytologic
8N0IZZpF8ts,1904,00:35:24.850,00:35:24.860,growth but here we have mark cytologic
8N0IZZpF8ts,1905,00:35:24.860,00:35:26.740,growth but here we have mark cytologic atypia and other features for melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,1906,00:35:26.740,00:35:26.750,atypia and other features for melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,1907,00:35:26.750,00:35:30.250,atypia and other features for melanoma but this solid line of melanocytes
8N0IZZpF8ts,1908,00:35:30.250,00:35:30.260,but this solid line of melanocytes
8N0IZZpF8ts,1909,00:35:30.260,00:35:32.140,but this solid line of melanocytes replacing the basal layer that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1910,00:35:32.140,00:35:32.150,replacing the basal layer that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1911,00:35:32.150,00:35:33.580,replacing the basal layer that's confluent growth and that's a really
8N0IZZpF8ts,1912,00:35:33.580,00:35:33.590,confluent growth and that's a really
8N0IZZpF8ts,1913,00:35:33.590,00:35:35.859,confluent growth and that's a really helpful feature for melanoma okay and as
8N0IZZpF8ts,1914,00:35:35.859,00:35:35.869,helpful feature for melanoma okay and as
8N0IZZpF8ts,1915,00:35:35.869,00:35:37.270,helpful feature for melanoma okay and as I think is like the best example of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1916,00:35:37.270,00:35:37.280,I think is like the best example of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1917,00:35:37.280,00:35:40.870,I think is like the best example of confluent growth in my collection let's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1918,00:35:40.870,00:35:40.880,confluent growth in my collection let's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1919,00:35:40.880,00:35:42.310,confluent growth in my collection let's see if I can find the other area without
8N0IZZpF8ts,1920,00:35:42.310,00:35:42.320,see if I can find the other area without
8N0IZZpF8ts,1921,00:35:42.320,00:35:46.930,see if I can find the other area without the slide falling here I'm going to turn
8N0IZZpF8ts,1922,00:35:46.930,00:35:46.940,the slide falling here I'm going to turn
8N0IZZpF8ts,1923,00:35:46.940,00:35:55.850,the slide falling here I'm going to turn it around
8N0IZZpF8ts,1924,00:35:58.740,00:35:58.750,ah here
8N0IZZpF8ts,1925,00:35:58.750,00:36:01.440,ah here this is a really great example really
8N0IZZpF8ts,1926,00:36:01.440,00:36:01.450,this is a really great example really
8N0IZZpF8ts,1927,00:36:01.450,00:36:04.650,this is a really great example really dramatic example so the confluent growth
8N0IZZpF8ts,1928,00:36:04.650,00:36:04.660,dramatic example so the confluent growth
8N0IZZpF8ts,1929,00:36:04.660,00:36:06.240,dramatic example so the confluent growth starts down here in the rear edges and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1930,00:36:06.240,00:36:06.250,starts down here in the rear edges and
8N0IZZpF8ts,1931,00:36:06.250,00:36:07.680,starts down here in the rear edges and moves all the way up the side of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1932,00:36:07.680,00:36:07.690,moves all the way up the side of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1933,00:36:07.690,00:36:08.040,moves all the way up the side of the Reedy
8N0IZZpF8ts,1934,00:36:08.040,00:36:08.050,Reedy
8N0IZZpF8ts,1935,00:36:08.050,00:36:10.620,Reedy all the way along here so down here the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1936,00:36:10.620,00:36:10.630,all the way along here so down here the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1937,00:36:10.630,00:36:12.360,all the way along here so down here the melanocytes don't have much pigment up
8N0IZZpF8ts,1938,00:36:12.360,00:36:12.370,melanocytes don't have much pigment up
8N0IZZpF8ts,1939,00:36:12.370,00:36:15.390,melanocytes don't have much pigment up here they do but they're all melanocytes
8N0IZZpF8ts,1940,00:36:15.390,00:36:15.400,here they do but they're all melanocytes
8N0IZZpF8ts,1941,00:36:15.400,00:36:16.830,here they do but they're all melanocytes and if you did a stain it would prove
8N0IZZpF8ts,1942,00:36:16.830,00:36:16.840,and if you did a stain it would prove
8N0IZZpF8ts,1943,00:36:16.840,00:36:18.870,and if you did a stain it would prove that and you can see a solid line of a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1944,00:36:18.870,00:36:18.880,that and you can see a solid line of a
8N0IZZpF8ts,1945,00:36:18.880,00:36:21.330,that and you can see a solid line of a typical melanocytes basically replacing
8N0IZZpF8ts,1946,00:36:21.330,00:36:21.340,typical melanocytes basically replacing
8N0IZZpF8ts,1947,00:36:21.340,00:36:23.700,typical melanocytes basically replacing the entire basal layer of the epidermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,1948,00:36:23.700,00:36:23.710,the entire basal layer of the epidermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,1949,00:36:23.710,00:36:25.680,the entire basal layer of the epidermis okay so that's going to fluent growth
8N0IZZpF8ts,1950,00:36:25.680,00:36:25.690,okay so that's going to fluent growth
8N0IZZpF8ts,1951,00:36:25.690,00:36:28.320,okay so that's going to fluent growth and that is a really helpful feature
8N0IZZpF8ts,1952,00:36:28.320,00:36:28.330,and that is a really helpful feature
8N0IZZpF8ts,1953,00:36:28.330,00:36:30.690,and that is a really helpful feature when it's present for melanoma now I
8N0IZZpF8ts,1954,00:36:30.690,00:36:30.700,when it's present for melanoma now I
8N0IZZpF8ts,1955,00:36:30.700,00:36:32.940,when it's present for melanoma now I often times melanomas don't have
8N0IZZpF8ts,1956,00:36:32.940,00:36:32.950,often times melanomas don't have
8N0IZZpF8ts,1957,00:36:32.950,00:36:34.860,often times melanomas don't have confluent growth so just because it
8N0IZZpF8ts,1958,00:36:34.860,00:36:34.870,confluent growth so just because it
8N0IZZpF8ts,1959,00:36:34.870,00:36:35.940,confluent growth so just because it doesn't have confluent growth doesn't
8N0IZZpF8ts,1960,00:36:35.940,00:36:35.950,doesn't have confluent growth doesn't
8N0IZZpF8ts,1961,00:36:35.950,00:36:38.460,doesn't have confluent growth doesn't mean that it's benign but if you see
8N0IZZpF8ts,1962,00:36:38.460,00:36:38.470,mean that it's benign but if you see
8N0IZZpF8ts,1963,00:36:38.470,00:36:39.750,mean that it's benign but if you see confluent girth you should be really
8N0IZZpF8ts,1964,00:36:39.750,00:36:39.760,confluent girth you should be really
8N0IZZpF8ts,1965,00:36:39.760,00:36:41.040,confluent girth you should be really worried about the possibility of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1966,00:36:41.040,00:36:41.050,worried about the possibility of
8N0IZZpF8ts,1967,00:36:41.050,00:36:45.750,worried about the possibility of melanoma okay and again these have
8N0IZZpF8ts,1968,00:36:45.750,00:36:45.760,melanoma okay and again these have
8N0IZZpF8ts,1969,00:36:45.760,00:36:48.360,melanoma okay and again these have really large nucleoli they're atypical
8N0IZZpF8ts,1970,00:36:48.360,00:36:48.370,really large nucleoli they're atypical
8N0IZZpF8ts,1971,00:36:48.370,00:36:50.220,really large nucleoli they're atypical cytologically it's a little hard to see
8N0IZZpF8ts,1972,00:36:50.220,00:36:50.230,cytologically it's a little hard to see
8N0IZZpF8ts,1973,00:36:50.230,00:36:52.530,cytologically it's a little hard to see the nucleoli or the nuclei and the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1974,00:36:52.530,00:36:52.540,the nucleoli or the nuclei and the
8N0IZZpF8ts,1975,00:36:52.540,00:36:53.610,the nucleoli or the nuclei and the nuclear features and some of them
8N0IZZpF8ts,1976,00:36:53.610,00:36:53.620,nuclear features and some of them
8N0IZZpF8ts,1977,00:36:53.620,00:36:55.980,nuclear features and some of them because of all the extra melanin pigment
8N0IZZpF8ts,1978,00:36:55.980,00:36:55.990,because of all the extra melanin pigment
8N0IZZpF8ts,1979,00:36:55.990,00:36:57.600,because of all the extra melanin pigment that they have but they're quite
8N0IZZpF8ts,1980,00:36:57.600,00:36:57.610,that they have but they're quite
8N0IZZpF8ts,1981,00:36:57.610,00:37:00.990,that they have but they're quite atypical alright and one thing that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1982,00:37:00.990,00:37:01.000,atypical alright and one thing that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,1983,00:37:01.000,00:37:02.760,atypical alright and one thing that's helpful a helpful clue for confluent
8N0IZZpF8ts,1984,00:37:02.760,00:37:02.770,helpful a helpful clue for confluent
8N0IZZpF8ts,1985,00:37:02.770,00:37:05.220,helpful a helpful clue for confluent growth is this what's happening here is
8N0IZZpF8ts,1986,00:37:05.220,00:37:05.230,growth is this what's happening here is
8N0IZZpF8ts,1987,00:37:05.230,00:37:07.200,growth is this what's happening here is the epidermis looks like it's separating
8N0IZZpF8ts,1988,00:37:07.200,00:37:07.210,the epidermis looks like it's separating
8N0IZZpF8ts,1989,00:37:07.210,00:37:08.310,the epidermis looks like it's separating from the dermis it's like a blister
8N0IZZpF8ts,1990,00:37:08.310,00:37:08.320,from the dermis it's like a blister
8N0IZZpF8ts,1991,00:37:08.320,00:37:09.780,from the dermis it's like a blister almost like a little a little
8N0IZZpF8ts,1992,00:37:09.780,00:37:09.790,almost like a little a little
8N0IZZpF8ts,1993,00:37:09.790,00:37:13.320,almost like a little a little sub-epidermal cleft or separation looks
8N0IZZpF8ts,1994,00:37:13.320,00:37:13.330,sub-epidermal cleft or separation looks
8N0IZZpF8ts,1995,00:37:13.330,00:37:14.760,sub-epidermal cleft or separation looks almost like what we see in small
8N0IZZpF8ts,1996,00:37:14.760,00:37:14.770,almost like what we see in small
8N0IZZpF8ts,1997,00:37:14.770,00:37:17.010,almost like what we see in small blisters in in inflammatory bolas
8N0IZZpF8ts,1998,00:37:17.010,00:37:17.020,blisters in in inflammatory bolas
8N0IZZpF8ts,1999,00:37:17.020,00:37:19.640,blisters in in inflammatory bolas dermatitis ease so if you see a blister
8N0IZZpF8ts,2000,00:37:19.640,00:37:19.650,dermatitis ease so if you see a blister
8N0IZZpF8ts,2001,00:37:19.650,00:37:21.600,dermatitis ease so if you see a blister again I'm using air quotes here if you
8N0IZZpF8ts,2002,00:37:21.600,00:37:21.610,again I'm using air quotes here if you
8N0IZZpF8ts,2003,00:37:21.610,00:37:23.160,again I'm using air quotes here if you see a blister what looks like a blister
8N0IZZpF8ts,2004,00:37:23.160,00:37:23.170,see a blister what looks like a blister
8N0IZZpF8ts,2005,00:37:23.170,00:37:25.530,see a blister what looks like a blister or a cleft or like the epidermis is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2006,00:37:25.530,00:37:25.540,or a cleft or like the epidermis is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2007,00:37:25.540,00:37:28.200,or a cleft or like the epidermis is unzipping itself from the underlying
8N0IZZpF8ts,2008,00:37:28.200,00:37:28.210,unzipping itself from the underlying
8N0IZZpF8ts,2009,00:37:28.210,00:37:30.090,unzipping itself from the underlying dermis in the midst of amyl an aesthetic

8N0IZZpF8ts,2011,00:37:30.100,00:37:32.160,dermis in the midst of amyl an aesthetic lesion that you have to think about
8N0IZZpF8ts,2012,00:37:32.160,00:37:32.170,lesion that you have to think about
8N0IZZpF8ts,2013,00:37:32.170,00:37:33.870,lesion that you have to think about melanoma until you can prove otherwise
8N0IZZpF8ts,2014,00:37:33.870,00:37:33.880,melanoma until you can prove otherwise
8N0IZZpF8ts,2015,00:37:33.880,00:37:36.300,melanoma until you can prove otherwise because that's a worrisome sign and what
8N0IZZpF8ts,2016,00:37:36.300,00:37:36.310,because that's a worrisome sign and what
8N0IZZpF8ts,2017,00:37:36.310,00:37:37.740,because that's a worrisome sign and what this is is an artifact and my
8N0IZZpF8ts,2018,00:37:37.740,00:37:37.750,this is is an artifact and my
8N0IZZpF8ts,2019,00:37:37.750,00:37:39.780,this is is an artifact and my understanding of why this probably
8N0IZZpF8ts,2020,00:37:39.780,00:37:39.790,understanding of why this probably
8N0IZZpF8ts,2021,00:37:39.790,00:37:41.190,understanding of why this probably happens is that there are so many
8N0IZZpF8ts,2022,00:37:41.190,00:37:41.200,happens is that there are so many
8N0IZZpF8ts,2023,00:37:41.200,00:37:43.680,happens is that there are so many melanocytes growing along here pushing
8N0IZZpF8ts,2024,00:37:43.680,00:37:43.690,melanocytes growing along here pushing
8N0IZZpF8ts,2025,00:37:43.690,00:37:45.090,melanocytes growing along here pushing the keratinocytes out of the way that

8N0IZZpF8ts,2043,00:38:01.930,00:38:04.050,hook on to the basement membrane we don't have that here because most of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2044,00:38:04.050,00:38:04.060,don't have that here because most of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2045,00:38:04.060,00:38:05.340,don't have that here because most of the keratinocytes have been pushed out of

8N0IZZpF8ts,2049,00:38:07.390,00:38:09.030,the way by melanocytes melanocytes do not have those same adhesion molecules
8N0IZZpF8ts,2050,00:38:09.030,00:38:09.040,not have those same adhesion molecules
8N0IZZpF8ts,2051,00:38:09.040,00:38:11.400,not have those same adhesion molecules they do not attach down to the basement
8N0IZZpF8ts,2052,00:38:11.400,00:38:11.410,they do not attach down to the basement
8N0IZZpF8ts,2053,00:38:11.410,00:38:12.229,they do not attach down to the basement membrane
8N0IZZpF8ts,2054,00:38:12.229,00:38:12.239,membrane
8N0IZZpF8ts,2055,00:38:12.239,00:38:14.209,membrane so the epidermis starts to cleft and
8N0IZZpF8ts,2056,00:38:14.209,00:38:14.219,so the epidermis starts to cleft and
8N0IZZpF8ts,2057,00:38:14.219,00:38:16.369,so the epidermis starts to cleft and lift away so this is not like an actual
8N0IZZpF8ts,2058,00:38:16.369,00:38:16.379,lift away so this is not like an actual
8N0IZZpF8ts,2059,00:38:16.379,00:38:18.199,lift away so this is not like an actual blister in the patient it's a artifact
8N0IZZpF8ts,2060,00:38:18.199,00:38:18.209,blister in the patient it's a artifact
8N0IZZpF8ts,2061,00:38:18.209,00:38:20.089,blister in the patient it's a artifact that we see microscopically kind of like
8N0IZZpF8ts,2062,00:38:20.089,00:38:20.099,that we see microscopically kind of like
8N0IZZpF8ts,2063,00:38:20.099,00:38:21.619,that we see microscopically kind of like the cleft an artifact that we see in
8N0IZZpF8ts,2064,00:38:21.619,00:38:21.629,the cleft an artifact that we see in
8N0IZZpF8ts,2065,00:38:21.629,00:38:23.839,the cleft an artifact that we see in basal cell carcinomas it's an artifact
8N0IZZpF8ts,2066,00:38:23.839,00:38:23.849,basal cell carcinomas it's an artifact
8N0IZZpF8ts,2067,00:38:23.849,00:38:25.729,basal cell carcinomas it's an artifact but it's a useful artifact because it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2068,00:38:25.729,00:38:25.739,but it's a useful artifact because it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2069,00:38:25.739,00:38:28.219,but it's a useful artifact because it's a clue to confluent growth and it's a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2070,00:38:28.219,00:38:28.229,a clue to confluent growth and it's a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2071,00:38:28.229,00:38:30.559,a clue to confluent growth and it's a clue to melanoma in the context of a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2072,00:38:30.559,00:38:30.569,clue to melanoma in the context of a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2073,00:38:30.569,00:38:32.689,clue to melanoma in the context of a mole anesthetic lesion okay so when you
8N0IZZpF8ts,2074,00:38:32.689,00:38:32.699,mole anesthetic lesion okay so when you
8N0IZZpF8ts,2075,00:38:32.699,00:38:34.489,mole anesthetic lesion okay so when you see that now I've seen times where
8N0IZZpF8ts,2076,00:38:34.489,00:38:34.499,see that now I've seen times where
8N0IZZpF8ts,2077,00:38:34.499,00:38:35.869,see that now I've seen times where there's splits like this that are just
8N0IZZpF8ts,2078,00:38:35.869,00:38:35.879,there's splits like this that are just
8N0IZZpF8ts,2079,00:38:35.879,00:38:37.729,there's splits like this that are just due to tears in the tissue or something
8N0IZZpF8ts,2080,00:38:37.729,00:38:37.739,due to tears in the tissue or something
8N0IZZpF8ts,2081,00:38:37.739,00:38:39.199,due to tears in the tissue or something so it's not that every time you see this
8N0IZZpF8ts,2082,00:38:39.199,00:38:39.209,so it's not that every time you see this
8N0IZZpF8ts,2083,00:38:39.209,00:38:41.119,so it's not that every time you see this cleft it's always melanoma but you
8N0IZZpF8ts,2084,00:38:41.119,00:38:41.129,cleft it's always melanoma but you
8N0IZZpF8ts,2085,00:38:41.129,00:38:43.129,cleft it's always melanoma but you should really stop and think about
8N0IZZpF8ts,2086,00:38:43.129,00:38:43.139,should really stop and think about
8N0IZZpF8ts,2087,00:38:43.139,00:38:45.079,should really stop and think about melanoma when you see this sign right
8N0IZZpF8ts,2088,00:38:45.079,00:38:45.089,melanoma when you see this sign right
8N0IZZpF8ts,2089,00:38:45.089,00:38:47.179,melanoma when you see this sign right here the unzipping sign or the the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2090,00:38:47.179,00:38:47.189,here the unzipping sign or the the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2091,00:38:47.189,00:38:49.489,here the unzipping sign or the the melania static blistering sign it's an
8N0IZZpF8ts,2092,00:38:49.489,00:38:49.499,melania static blistering sign it's an
8N0IZZpF8ts,2093,00:38:49.499,00:38:50.809,melania static blistering sign it's an artifact that's really useful
8N0IZZpF8ts,2094,00:38:50.809,00:38:50.819,artifact that's really useful
8N0IZZpF8ts,2095,00:38:50.819,00:38:54.019,artifact that's really useful okay so confluent growth like I said is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2096,00:38:54.019,00:38:54.029,okay so confluent growth like I said is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2097,00:38:54.029,00:38:56.749,okay so confluent growth like I said is often not nearly as dramatic as we see
8N0IZZpF8ts,2098,00:38:56.749,00:38:56.759,often not nearly as dramatic as we see
8N0IZZpF8ts,2099,00:38:56.759,00:38:59.029,often not nearly as dramatic as we see in this case of acro melanoma but I
8N0IZZpF8ts,2100,00:38:59.029,00:38:59.039,in this case of acro melanoma but I
8N0IZZpF8ts,2101,00:38:59.039,00:39:01.999,in this case of acro melanoma but I think this is a good example of a really
8N0IZZpF8ts,2102,00:39:01.999,00:39:02.009,think this is a good example of a really
8N0IZZpF8ts,2103,00:39:02.009,00:39:04.419,think this is a good example of a really classic really ideal example of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2104,00:39:04.419,00:39:04.429,classic really ideal example of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2105,00:39:04.429,00:39:06.469,classic really ideal example of confluence and here's more of it over
8N0IZZpF8ts,2106,00:39:06.469,00:39:06.479,confluence and here's more of it over
8N0IZZpF8ts,2107,00:39:06.479,00:39:08.179,confluence and here's more of it over here with that same look again that
8N0IZZpF8ts,2108,00:39:08.179,00:39:08.189,here with that same look again that
8N0IZZpF8ts,2109,00:39:08.189,00:39:10.099,here with that same look again that blistering artifact or the unzipping
8N0IZZpF8ts,2110,00:39:10.099,00:39:10.109,blistering artifact or the unzipping
8N0IZZpF8ts,2111,00:39:10.109,00:39:11.839,blistering artifact or the unzipping sign where the epidermis and the dermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,2112,00:39:11.839,00:39:11.849,sign where the epidermis and the dermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,2113,00:39:11.849,00:39:13.189,sign where the epidermis and the dermis are starting to separate from one
8N0IZZpF8ts,2114,00:39:13.189,00:39:13.199,are starting to separate from one
8N0IZZpF8ts,2115,00:39:13.199,00:39:14.689,are starting to separate from one another because of overgrowth of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2116,00:39:14.689,00:39:14.699,another because of overgrowth of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2117,00:39:14.699,00:39:17.119,another because of overgrowth of the melanocytes replacing the basal layer
8N0IZZpF8ts,2118,00:39:17.119,00:39:17.129,melanocytes replacing the basal layer
8N0IZZpF8ts,2119,00:39:17.129,00:39:19.699,melanocytes replacing the basal layer keratinocytes another feature that you
8N0IZZpF8ts,2120,00:39:19.699,00:39:19.709,keratinocytes another feature that you
8N0IZZpF8ts,2121,00:39:19.709,00:39:21.259,keratinocytes another feature that you can use when you're trying to decide if
8N0IZZpF8ts,2122,00:39:21.259,00:39:21.269,can use when you're trying to decide if
8N0IZZpF8ts,2123,00:39:21.269,00:39:23.359,can use when you're trying to decide if something is confluent is look for the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2124,00:39:23.359,00:39:23.369,something is confluent is look for the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2125,00:39:23.369,00:39:25.339,something is confluent is look for the egg Naxal structures and this again is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2126,00:39:25.339,00:39:25.349,egg Naxal structures and this again is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2127,00:39:25.349,00:39:28.279,egg Naxal structures and this again is particularly true in acryl indigenous
8N0IZZpF8ts,2128,00:39:28.279,00:39:28.289,particularly true in acryl indigenous
8N0IZZpF8ts,2129,00:39:28.289,00:39:29.629,particularly true in acryl indigenous melanomas they have this really strong
8N0IZZpF8ts,2130,00:39:29.629,00:39:29.639,melanomas they have this really strong
8N0IZZpF8ts,2131,00:39:29.639,00:39:33.049,melanomas they have this really strong tendency to grow down the eccrine ducts
8N0IZZpF8ts,2132,00:39:33.049,00:39:33.059,tendency to grow down the eccrine ducts
8N0IZZpF8ts,2133,00:39:33.059,00:39:34.999,tendency to grow down the eccrine ducts and so here's a necron duct and there a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2134,00:39:34.999,00:39:35.009,and so here's a necron duct and there a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2135,00:39:35.009,00:39:36.889,and so here's a necron duct and there a way I can tell is it's a little a little
8N0IZZpF8ts,2136,00:39:36.889,00:39:36.899,way I can tell is it's a little a little
8N0IZZpF8ts,2137,00:39:36.899,00:39:38.509,way I can tell is it's a little a little structure made of keratinocyte like
8N0IZZpF8ts,2138,00:39:38.509,00:39:38.519,structure made of keratinocyte like
8N0IZZpF8ts,2139,00:39:38.519,00:39:40.099,structure made of keratinocyte like cells and in the center there's a little
8N0IZZpF8ts,2140,00:39:40.099,00:39:40.109,cells and in the center there's a little
8N0IZZpF8ts,2141,00:39:40.109,00:39:41.869,cells and in the center there's a little tiny hole that you can barely see here
8N0IZZpF8ts,2142,00:39:41.869,00:39:41.879,tiny hole that you can barely see here
8N0IZZpF8ts,2143,00:39:41.879,00:39:44.389,tiny hole that you can barely see here and it's lined by a little pink cuticle
8N0IZZpF8ts,2144,00:39:44.389,00:39:44.399,and it's lined by a little pink cuticle
8N0IZZpF8ts,2145,00:39:44.399,00:39:46.189,and it's lined by a little pink cuticle you just barely see it so we're cut kind
8N0IZZpF8ts,2146,00:39:46.189,00:39:46.199,you just barely see it so we're cut kind
8N0IZZpF8ts,2147,00:39:46.199,00:39:47.479,you just barely see it so we're cut kind of at an angle so you can't see a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2148,00:39:47.479,00:39:47.489,of at an angle so you can't see a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2149,00:39:47.489,00:39:49.789,of at an angle so you can't see a perfect empty lumen in the middle but
8N0IZZpF8ts,2150,00:39:49.789,00:39:49.799,perfect empty lumen in the middle but
8N0IZZpF8ts,2151,00:39:49.799,00:39:51.529,perfect empty lumen in the middle but this is a duct and look what these are
8N0IZZpF8ts,2152,00:39:51.529,00:39:51.539,this is a duct and look what these are
8N0IZZpF8ts,2153,00:39:51.539,00:39:53.419,this is a duct and look what these are the these are the the epithelial cells
8N0IZZpF8ts,2154,00:39:53.419,00:39:53.429,the these are the the epithelial cells
8N0IZZpF8ts,2155,00:39:53.429,00:39:55.159,the these are the the epithelial cells of the duct that look a lot like
8N0IZZpF8ts,2156,00:39:55.159,00:39:55.169,of the duct that look a lot like
8N0IZZpF8ts,2157,00:39:55.169,00:39:56.869,of the duct that look a lot like keratinocytes and then around the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2158,00:39:56.869,00:39:56.879,keratinocytes and then around the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2159,00:39:56.879,00:39:59.359,keratinocytes and then around the outside we have large atypical
8N0IZZpF8ts,2160,00:39:59.359,00:39:59.369,outside we have large atypical
8N0IZZpF8ts,2161,00:39:59.369,00:40:02.629,outside we have large atypical melanocytes completely wrapping and
8N0IZZpF8ts,2162,00:40:02.629,00:40:02.639,melanocytes completely wrapping and
8N0IZZpF8ts,2163,00:40:02.639,00:40:05.149,melanocytes completely wrapping and replacing the basal layer of the ductal
8N0IZZpF8ts,2164,00:40:05.149,00:40:05.159,replacing the basal layer of the ductal
8N0IZZpF8ts,2165,00:40:05.159,00:40:07.729,replacing the basal layer of the ductal epithelial cells so sometimes when you
8N0IZZpF8ts,2166,00:40:07.729,00:40:07.739,epithelial cells so sometimes when you
8N0IZZpF8ts,2167,00:40:07.739,00:40:09.229,epithelial cells so sometimes when you can't when you're not sure if there's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2168,00:40:09.229,00:40:09.239,can't when you're not sure if there's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2169,00:40:09.239,00:40:10.579,can't when you're not sure if there's confluent growth in the epidermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,2170,00:40:10.579,00:40:10.589,confluent growth in the epidermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,2171,00:40:10.589,00:40:12.349,confluent growth in the epidermis looking and seeing if you're having
8N0IZZpF8ts,2172,00:40:12.349,00:40:12.359,looking and seeing if you're having
8N0IZZpF8ts,2173,00:40:12.359,00:40:14.659,looking and seeing if you're having single-cell confluent growth down the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2174,00:40:14.659,00:40:14.669,single-cell confluent growth down the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2175,00:40:14.669,00:40:16.369,single-cell confluent growth down the eccrine ducts are down here follicles
8N0IZZpF8ts,2176,00:40:16.369,00:40:16.379,eccrine ducts are down here follicles
8N0IZZpF8ts,2177,00:40:16.379,00:40:18.859,eccrine ducts are down here follicles can be incredibly useful and I've
8N0IZZpF8ts,2178,00:40:18.859,00:40:18.869,can be incredibly useful and I've
8N0IZZpF8ts,2179,00:40:18.869,00:40:20.089,can be incredibly useful and I've definitely had times where that feature
8N0IZZpF8ts,2180,00:40:20.089,00:40:20.099,definitely had times where that feature
8N0IZZpF8ts,2181,00:40:20.099,00:40:21.829,definitely had times where that feature was what helped me make the diagnosis of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2182,00:40:21.829,00:40:21.839,was what helped me make the diagnosis of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2183,00:40:21.839,00:40:24.229,was what helped me make the diagnosis of melanoma in this case I think has some
8N0IZZpF8ts,2184,00:40:24.229,00:40:24.239,melanoma in this case I think has some
8N0IZZpF8ts,2185,00:40:24.239,00:40:25.910,melanoma in this case I think has some other examples let me find
8N0IZZpF8ts,2186,00:40:25.910,00:40:25.920,other examples let me find
8N0IZZpF8ts,2187,00:40:25.920,00:40:28.670,other examples let me find we find another place here's another
8N0IZZpF8ts,2188,00:40:28.670,00:40:28.680,we find another place here's another
8N0IZZpF8ts,2189,00:40:28.680,00:40:30.740,we find another place here's another duct and now that one you definitely can
8N0IZZpF8ts,2190,00:40:30.740,00:40:30.750,duct and now that one you definitely can
8N0IZZpF8ts,2191,00:40:30.750,00:40:32.240,duct and now that one you definitely can see there's a nice lumen in the middle
8N0IZZpF8ts,2192,00:40:32.240,00:40:32.250,see there's a nice lumen in the middle
8N0IZZpF8ts,2193,00:40:32.250,00:40:33.650,see there's a nice lumen in the middle there so this is an echo in duct and
8N0IZZpF8ts,2194,00:40:33.650,00:40:33.660,there so this is an echo in duct and
8N0IZZpF8ts,2195,00:40:33.660,00:40:35.720,there so this is an echo in duct and again it's not completely wrapped by a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2196,00:40:35.720,00:40:35.730,again it's not completely wrapped by a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2197,00:40:35.730,00:40:37.340,again it's not completely wrapped by a typical melanocytes but you can
8N0IZZpF8ts,2198,00:40:37.340,00:40:37.350,typical melanocytes but you can
8N0IZZpF8ts,2199,00:40:37.350,00:40:39.080,typical melanocytes but you can definitely see single atypical
8N0IZZpF8ts,2200,00:40:39.080,00:40:39.090,definitely see single atypical
8N0IZZpF8ts,2201,00:40:39.090,00:40:41.510,definitely see single atypical melanocytes that are spreading down into
8N0IZZpF8ts,2202,00:40:41.510,00:40:41.520,melanocytes that are spreading down into
8N0IZZpF8ts,2203,00:40:41.520,00:40:44.120,melanocytes that are spreading down into the duct and replacing the basal layer
8N0IZZpF8ts,2204,00:40:44.120,00:40:44.130,the duct and replacing the basal layer
8N0IZZpF8ts,2205,00:40:44.130,00:40:46.100,the duct and replacing the basal layer and sometimes they can be so florid that
8N0IZZpF8ts,2206,00:40:46.100,00:40:46.110,and sometimes they can be so florid that
8N0IZZpF8ts,2207,00:40:46.110,00:40:48.380,and sometimes they can be so florid that they can replace most of the epithelial
8N0IZZpF8ts,2208,00:40:48.380,00:40:48.390,they can replace most of the epithelial
8N0IZZpF8ts,2209,00:40:48.390,00:40:51.500,they can replace most of the epithelial cells in the sweat duct okay and in that
8N0IZZpF8ts,2210,00:40:51.500,00:40:51.510,cells in the sweat duct okay and in that
8N0IZZpF8ts,2211,00:40:51.510,00:40:53.150,cells in the sweat duct okay and in that case they can kind of be mistaken for
8N0IZZpF8ts,2212,00:40:53.150,00:40:53.160,case they can kind of be mistaken for
8N0IZZpF8ts,2213,00:40:53.160,00:40:55.820,case they can kind of be mistaken for invasion actually you can like look at
8N0IZZpF8ts,2214,00:40:55.820,00:40:55.830,invasion actually you can like look at
8N0IZZpF8ts,2215,00:40:55.830,00:40:57.050,invasion actually you can like look at this here you could say oh this is a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2216,00:40:57.050,00:40:57.060,this here you could say oh this is a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2217,00:40:57.060,00:40:59.210,this here you could say oh this is a nest of invasive melanoma well actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,2218,00:40:59.210,00:40:59.220,nest of invasive melanoma well actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,2219,00:40:59.220,00:41:01.250,nest of invasive melanoma well actually there are probably some keratinocytes or
8N0IZZpF8ts,2220,00:41:01.250,00:41:01.260,there are probably some keratinocytes or
8N0IZZpF8ts,2221,00:41:01.260,00:41:02.930,there are probably some keratinocytes or I'm sorry some epithelial cells left in
8N0IZZpF8ts,2222,00:41:02.930,00:41:02.940,I'm sorry some epithelial cells left in
8N0IZZpF8ts,2223,00:41:02.940,00:41:04.190,I'm sorry some epithelial cells left in there so this is probably actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,2224,00:41:04.190,00:41:04.200,there so this is probably actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,2225,00:41:04.200,00:41:06.650,there so this is probably actually incite to spread down a duct so you
8N0IZZpF8ts,2226,00:41:06.650,00:41:06.660,incite to spread down a duct so you
8N0IZZpF8ts,2227,00:41:06.660,00:41:08.240,incite to spread down a duct so you wouldn't want to measure that as an
8N0IZZpF8ts,2228,00:41:08.240,00:41:08.250,wouldn't want to measure that as an
8N0IZZpF8ts,2229,00:41:08.250,00:41:10.160,wouldn't want to measure that as an invasive area in a melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,2230,00:41:10.160,00:41:10.170,invasive area in a melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,2231,00:41:10.170,00:41:11.930,invasive area in a melanoma now this melanoma has other areas like
8N0IZZpF8ts,2232,00:41:11.930,00:41:11.940,now this melanoma has other areas like
8N0IZZpF8ts,2233,00:41:11.940,00:41:13.490,now this melanoma has other areas like this that are definitely invasive we see
8N0IZZpF8ts,2234,00:41:13.490,00:41:13.500,this that are definitely invasive we see
8N0IZZpF8ts,2235,00:41:13.500,00:41:15.560,this that are definitely invasive we see atypical melanocytes that are invading
8N0IZZpF8ts,2236,00:41:15.560,00:41:15.570,atypical melanocytes that are invading
8N0IZZpF8ts,2237,00:41:15.570,00:41:17.330,atypical melanocytes that are invading the dermis and again it's a little hard
8N0IZZpF8ts,2238,00:41:17.330,00:41:17.340,the dermis and again it's a little hard
8N0IZZpF8ts,2239,00:41:17.340,00:41:18.710,the dermis and again it's a little hard here because look at all the pigment and
8N0IZZpF8ts,2240,00:41:18.710,00:41:18.720,here because look at all the pigment and
8N0IZZpF8ts,2241,00:41:18.720,00:41:20.390,here because look at all the pigment and a lot of these really darkly pigmented
8N0IZZpF8ts,2242,00:41:20.390,00:41:20.400,a lot of these really darkly pigmented
8N0IZZpF8ts,2243,00:41:20.400,00:41:22.000,a lot of these really darkly pigmented cells are actually Melania phages
8N0IZZpF8ts,2244,00:41:22.000,00:41:22.010,cells are actually Melania phages
8N0IZZpF8ts,2245,00:41:22.010,00:41:24.020,cells are actually Melania phages whereas these cells that have a little
8N0IZZpF8ts,2246,00:41:24.020,00:41:24.030,whereas these cells that have a little
8N0IZZpF8ts,2247,00:41:24.030,00:41:25.850,whereas these cells that have a little bit more of that dirty grayish cytoplasm
8N0IZZpF8ts,2248,00:41:25.850,00:41:25.860,bit more of that dirty grayish cytoplasm
8N0IZZpF8ts,2249,00:41:25.860,00:41:27.230,bit more of that dirty grayish cytoplasm even though they have some pigment
8N0IZZpF8ts,2250,00:41:27.230,00:41:27.240,even though they have some pigment
8N0IZZpF8ts,2251,00:41:27.240,00:41:29.000,even though they have some pigment they're not nearly like as these are
8N0IZZpF8ts,2252,00:41:29.000,00:41:29.010,they're not nearly like as these are
8N0IZZpF8ts,2253,00:41:29.010,00:41:30.560,they're not nearly like as these are like so dark brown that they almost look
8N0IZZpF8ts,2254,00:41:30.560,00:41:30.570,like so dark brown that they almost look
8N0IZZpF8ts,2255,00:41:30.570,00:41:32.840,like so dark brown that they almost look black these are Ileana phages these are
8N0IZZpF8ts,2256,00:41:32.840,00:41:32.850,black these are Ileana phages these are
8N0IZZpF8ts,2257,00:41:32.850,00:41:34.790,black these are Ileana phages these are melanocytes sometimes the nuclear
8N0IZZpF8ts,2258,00:41:34.790,00:41:34.800,melanocytes sometimes the nuclear
8N0IZZpF8ts,2259,00:41:34.800,00:41:36.320,melanocytes sometimes the nuclear features can help you sometimes seeing
8N0IZZpF8ts,2260,00:41:36.320,00:41:36.330,features can help you sometimes seeing
8N0IZZpF8ts,2261,00:41:36.330,00:41:38.360,features can help you sometimes seeing the grayish cytoplasm can help if you're
8N0IZZpF8ts,2262,00:41:38.360,00:41:38.370,the grayish cytoplasm can help if you're
8N0IZZpF8ts,2263,00:41:38.370,00:41:40.400,the grayish cytoplasm can help if you're really struggling to tell if the dermal
8N0IZZpF8ts,2264,00:41:40.400,00:41:40.410,really struggling to tell if the dermal
8N0IZZpF8ts,2265,00:41:40.410,00:41:43.040,really struggling to tell if the dermal cells are melanocytes versus Melania
8N0IZZpF8ts,2266,00:41:43.040,00:41:43.050,cells are melanocytes versus Melania
8N0IZZpF8ts,2267,00:41:43.050,00:41:45.650,cells are melanocytes versus Melania phages do an immuno stain and that can
8N0IZZpF8ts,2268,00:41:45.650,00:41:45.660,phages do an immuno stain and that can
8N0IZZpF8ts,2269,00:41:45.660,00:41:46.970,phages do an immuno stain and that can really help solve the problem and that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2270,00:41:46.970,00:41:46.980,really help solve the problem and that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2271,00:41:46.980,00:41:48.230,really help solve the problem and that's really important because if they're just
8N0IZZpF8ts,2272,00:41:48.230,00:41:48.240,really important because if they're just
8N0IZZpF8ts,2273,00:41:48.240,00:41:50.120,really important because if they're just Melania phages then you might have a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2274,00:41:50.120,00:41:50.130,Melania phages then you might have a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2275,00:41:50.130,00:41:51.860,Melania phages then you might have a melanoma in sight - but no invasive
8N0IZZpF8ts,2276,00:41:51.860,00:41:51.870,melanoma in sight - but no invasive
8N0IZZpF8ts,2277,00:41:51.870,00:41:54.080,melanoma in sight - but no invasive growth and if they're Malaya melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,2278,00:41:54.080,00:41:54.090,growth and if they're Malaya melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,2279,00:41:54.090,00:41:55.130,growth and if they're Malaya melanoma cells in the dermis and then you have
8N0IZZpF8ts,2280,00:41:55.130,00:41:55.140,cells in the dermis and then you have
8N0IZZpF8ts,2281,00:41:55.140,00:41:57.200,cells in the dermis and then you have invasion and that's going to change the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2282,00:41:57.200,00:41:57.210,invasion and that's going to change the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2283,00:41:57.210,00:41:58.700,invasion and that's going to change the treatment and potentially change the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2284,00:41:58.700,00:41:58.710,treatment and potentially change the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2285,00:41:58.710,00:42:00.290,treatment and potentially change the prognosis for the patient so it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2286,00:42:00.290,00:42:00.300,prognosis for the patient so it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2287,00:42:00.300,00:42:01.760,prognosis for the patient so it's important to make that distinction
8N0IZZpF8ts,2288,00:42:01.760,00:42:01.770,important to make that distinction
8N0IZZpF8ts,2289,00:42:01.770,00:42:04.970,important to make that distinction here's another example of a duct kind of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2290,00:42:04.970,00:42:04.980,here's another example of a duct kind of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2291,00:42:04.980,00:42:06.380,here's another example of a duct kind of funny where we've got here's the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2292,00:42:06.380,00:42:06.390,funny where we've got here's the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2293,00:42:06.390,00:42:08.210,funny where we've got here's the epithelial cells in the middle and a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2294,00:42:08.210,00:42:08.220,epithelial cells in the middle and a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2295,00:42:08.220,00:42:11.260,epithelial cells in the middle and a typical melanocytes are on the outside
8N0IZZpF8ts,2296,00:42:11.260,00:42:11.270,typical melanocytes are on the outside
8N0IZZpF8ts,2297,00:42:11.270,00:42:13.460,typical melanocytes are on the outside one other thing I guess that I'll say
8N0IZZpF8ts,2298,00:42:13.460,00:42:13.470,one other thing I guess that I'll say
8N0IZZpF8ts,2299,00:42:13.470,00:42:18.880,one other thing I guess that I'll say before we move on about confluent growth
8N0IZZpF8ts,2300,00:42:18.880,00:42:18.890,before we move on about confluent growth
8N0IZZpF8ts,2301,00:42:18.890,00:42:22.430,before we move on about confluent growth is that it doesn't always it doesn't
8N0IZZpF8ts,2302,00:42:22.430,00:42:22.440,is that it doesn't always it doesn't
8N0IZZpF8ts,2303,00:42:22.440,00:42:25.130,is that it doesn't always it doesn't always work so so clearly as I showed in
8N0IZZpF8ts,2304,00:42:25.130,00:42:25.140,always work so so clearly as I showed in
8N0IZZpF8ts,2305,00:42:25.140,00:42:28.310,always work so so clearly as I showed in the previous area but what I start to
8N0IZZpF8ts,2306,00:42:28.310,00:42:28.320,the previous area but what I start to
8N0IZZpF8ts,2307,00:42:28.320,00:42:30.230,the previous area but what I start to worry about is that a lot of times Nev I
8N0IZZpF8ts,2308,00:42:30.230,00:42:30.240,worry about is that a lot of times Nev I
8N0IZZpF8ts,2309,00:42:30.240,00:42:32.120,worry about is that a lot of times Nev I will have nests of melanocytes down the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2310,00:42:32.120,00:42:32.130,will have nests of melanocytes down the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2311,00:42:32.130,00:42:35.150,will have nests of melanocytes down the tips of ridi and when I start to see
8N0IZZpF8ts,2312,00:42:35.150,00:42:35.160,tips of ridi and when I start to see
8N0IZZpF8ts,2313,00:42:35.160,00:42:37.250,tips of ridi and when I start to see single melanocytes crawling up in
8N0IZZpF8ts,2314,00:42:37.250,00:42:37.260,single melanocytes crawling up in
8N0IZZpF8ts,2315,00:42:37.260,00:42:38.350,single melanocytes crawling up in between
8N0IZZpF8ts,2316,00:42:38.350,00:42:38.360,between
8N0IZZpF8ts,2317,00:42:38.360,00:42:41.620,between the inter ad space the area over top of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2318,00:42:41.620,00:42:41.630,the inter ad space the area over top of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2319,00:42:41.630,00:42:44.350,the inter ad space the area over top of the dermal papilla over or the papillae
8N0IZZpF8ts,2320,00:42:44.350,00:42:44.360,the dermal papilla over or the papillae
8N0IZZpF8ts,2321,00:42:44.360,00:42:46.570,the dermal papilla over or the papillae if we're saying multiple if you start to
8N0IZZpF8ts,2322,00:42:46.570,00:42:46.580,if we're saying multiple if you start to
8N0IZZpF8ts,2323,00:42:46.580,00:42:47.950,if we're saying multiple if you start to see a lot of melanocytes filling this
8N0IZZpF8ts,2324,00:42:47.950,00:42:47.960,see a lot of melanocytes filling this
8N0IZZpF8ts,2325,00:42:47.960,00:42:50.380,see a lot of melanocytes filling this space in here that starts to worry me
8N0IZZpF8ts,2326,00:42:50.380,00:42:50.390,space in here that starts to worry me
8N0IZZpF8ts,2327,00:42:50.390,00:42:52.030,space in here that starts to worry me that we're getting into confluent growth
8N0IZZpF8ts,2328,00:42:52.030,00:42:52.040,that we're getting into confluent growth
8N0IZZpF8ts,2329,00:42:52.040,00:42:53.710,that we're getting into confluent growth now that's a again that's kind of a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2330,00:42:53.710,00:42:53.720,now that's a again that's kind of a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2331,00:42:53.720,00:42:54.760,now that's a again that's kind of a subtle thing that can be hard to
8N0IZZpF8ts,2332,00:42:54.760,00:42:54.770,subtle thing that can be hard to
8N0IZZpF8ts,2333,00:42:54.770,00:42:57.250,subtle thing that can be hard to interpret I definitely see some single
8N0IZZpF8ts,2334,00:42:57.250,00:42:57.260,interpret I definitely see some single
8N0IZZpF8ts,2335,00:42:57.260,00:42:59.110,interpret I definitely see some single melanocytes in the inner reading space
8N0IZZpF8ts,2336,00:42:59.110,00:42:59.120,melanocytes in the inner reading space
8N0IZZpF8ts,2337,00:42:59.120,00:43:01.690,melanocytes in the inner reading space in benign IVA on a regular basis but if
8N0IZZpF8ts,2338,00:43:01.690,00:43:01.700,in benign IVA on a regular basis but if
8N0IZZpF8ts,2339,00:43:01.700,00:43:03.160,in benign IVA on a regular basis but if that's one thing I look for if I'm
8N0IZZpF8ts,2340,00:43:03.160,00:43:03.170,that's one thing I look for if I'm
8N0IZZpF8ts,2341,00:43:03.170,00:43:04.390,that's one thing I look for if I'm having a hard time with the lesion I
8N0IZZpF8ts,2342,00:43:04.390,00:43:04.400,having a hard time with the lesion I
8N0IZZpF8ts,2343,00:43:04.400,00:43:06.070,having a hard time with the lesion I start looking and seeing are there very
8N0IZZpF8ts,2344,00:43:06.070,00:43:06.080,start looking and seeing are there very
8N0IZZpF8ts,2345,00:43:06.080,00:43:08.590,start looking and seeing are there very many cells growing in that space because
8N0IZZpF8ts,2346,00:43:08.590,00:43:08.600,many cells growing in that space because
8N0IZZpF8ts,2347,00:43:08.600,00:43:10.690,many cells growing in that space because again that's the idea that the that the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2348,00:43:10.690,00:43:10.700,again that's the idea that the that the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2349,00:43:10.700,00:43:12.340,again that's the idea that the that the melanocytes are starting to get a little
8N0IZZpF8ts,2350,00:43:12.340,00:43:12.350,melanocytes are starting to get a little
8N0IZZpF8ts,2351,00:43:12.350,00:43:14.140,melanocytes are starting to get a little bit too rambunctious and are growing
8N0IZZpF8ts,2352,00:43:14.140,00:43:14.150,bit too rambunctious and are growing
8N0IZZpF8ts,2353,00:43:14.150,00:43:18.010,bit too rambunctious and are growing upwards and starting to replace parts of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2354,00:43:18.010,00:43:18.020,upwards and starting to replace parts of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2355,00:43:18.020,00:43:21.100,upwards and starting to replace parts of the basal layer so like here look at
8N0IZZpF8ts,2356,00:43:21.100,00:43:21.110,the basal layer so like here look at
8N0IZZpF8ts,2357,00:43:21.110,00:43:22.840,the basal layer so like here look at this we're starting to see single single
8N0IZZpF8ts,2358,00:43:22.840,00:43:22.850,this we're starting to see single single
8N0IZZpF8ts,2359,00:43:22.850,00:43:24.790,this we're starting to see single single single melanocytes kind of coming in
8N0IZZpF8ts,2360,00:43:24.790,00:43:24.800,single melanocytes kind of coming in
8N0IZZpF8ts,2361,00:43:24.800,00:43:26.470,single melanocytes kind of coming in here by itself that's not enough for
8N0IZZpF8ts,2362,00:43:26.470,00:43:26.480,here by itself that's not enough for
8N0IZZpF8ts,2363,00:43:26.480,00:43:28.480,here by itself that's not enough for melanoma I think but it's a sign that
8N0IZZpF8ts,2364,00:43:28.480,00:43:28.490,melanoma I think but it's a sign that
8N0IZZpF8ts,2365,00:43:28.490,00:43:30.760,melanoma I think but it's a sign that makes me start to wonder and worry a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2366,00:43:30.760,00:43:30.770,makes me start to wonder and worry a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2367,00:43:30.770,00:43:32.470,makes me start to wonder and worry a little bit and then over here I know
8N0IZZpF8ts,2368,00:43:32.470,00:43:32.480,little bit and then over here I know
8N0IZZpF8ts,2369,00:43:32.480,00:43:34.540,little bit and then over here I know it's upside down but you can again see
8N0IZZpF8ts,2370,00:43:34.540,00:43:34.550,it's upside down but you can again see
8N0IZZpF8ts,2371,00:43:34.550,00:43:36.430,it's upside down but you can again see complete replacement of the basal layer
8N0IZZpF8ts,2372,00:43:36.430,00:43:36.440,complete replacement of the basal layer
8N0IZZpF8ts,2373,00:43:36.440,00:43:39.670,complete replacement of the basal layer by atypical melanocytes and that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2374,00:43:39.670,00:43:39.680,by atypical melanocytes and that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2375,00:43:39.680,00:43:42.580,by atypical melanocytes and that's obvious confluent growth so I hope that
8N0IZZpF8ts,2376,00:43:42.580,00:43:42.590,obvious confluent growth so I hope that
8N0IZZpF8ts,2377,00:43:42.590,00:43:44.320,obvious confluent growth so I hope that helps you understand confluence a little
8N0IZZpF8ts,2378,00:43:44.320,00:43:44.330,helps you understand confluence a little
8N0IZZpF8ts,2379,00:43:44.330,00:43:46.510,helps you understand confluence a little bit better and I admit it's kind of a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2380,00:43:46.510,00:43:46.520,bit better and I admit it's kind of a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2381,00:43:46.520,00:43:48.640,bit better and I admit it's kind of a tricky topic but if you do an immuno
8N0IZZpF8ts,2382,00:43:48.640,00:43:48.650,tricky topic but if you do an immuno
8N0IZZpF8ts,2383,00:43:48.650,00:43:50.620,tricky topic but if you do an immuno stain what it'll look like is like a kid
8N0IZZpF8ts,2384,00:43:50.620,00:43:50.630,stain what it'll look like is like a kid
8N0IZZpF8ts,2385,00:43:50.630,00:43:53.200,stain what it'll look like is like a kid took a crayon and color it a solid line
8N0IZZpF8ts,2386,00:43:53.200,00:43:53.210,took a crayon and color it a solid line
8N0IZZpF8ts,2387,00:43:53.210,00:43:54.700,took a crayon and color it a solid line right along the basal layer it just
8N0IZZpF8ts,2388,00:43:54.700,00:43:54.710,right along the basal layer it just
8N0IZZpF8ts,2389,00:43:54.710,00:43:57.190,right along the basal layer it just completely replaces most of the basal
8N0IZZpF8ts,2390,00:43:57.190,00:43:57.200,completely replaces most of the basal
8N0IZZpF8ts,2391,00:43:57.200,00:43:59.110,completely replaces most of the basal layer of the epidermis when you have
8N0IZZpF8ts,2392,00:43:59.110,00:43:59.120,layer of the epidermis when you have
8N0IZZpF8ts,2393,00:43:59.120,00:44:05.310,layer of the epidermis when you have really dramatic influence
8N0IZZpF8ts,2394,00:44:07.770,00:44:07.780,now look here's an example where the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2395,00:44:07.780,00:44:09.660,now look here's an example where the entire epidermis is basically missing
8N0IZZpF8ts,2396,00:44:09.660,00:44:09.670,entire epidermis is basically missing
8N0IZZpF8ts,2397,00:44:09.670,00:44:11.370,entire epidermis is basically missing and this is also from a kernel scanning
8N0IZZpF8ts,2398,00:44:11.370,00:44:11.380,and this is also from a kernel scanning
8N0IZZpF8ts,2399,00:44:11.380,00:44:12.960,and this is also from a kernel scanning this is a large worrisome lesion
8N0IZZpF8ts,2400,00:44:12.960,00:44:12.970,this is a large worrisome lesion
8N0IZZpF8ts,2401,00:44:12.970,00:44:14.910,this is a large worrisome lesion clinically a punch biopsy was done
8N0IZZpF8ts,2402,00:44:14.910,00:44:14.920,clinically a punch biopsy was done
8N0IZZpF8ts,2403,00:44:14.920,00:44:17.370,clinically a punch biopsy was done because it was so large that it wouldn't
8N0IZZpF8ts,2404,00:44:17.370,00:44:17.380,because it was so large that it wouldn't
8N0IZZpF8ts,2405,00:44:17.380,00:44:19.050,because it was so large that it wouldn't have been feasible to remove the whole
8N0IZZpF8ts,2406,00:44:19.050,00:44:19.060,have been feasible to remove the whole
8N0IZZpF8ts,2407,00:44:19.060,00:44:23.240,have been feasible to remove the whole thing thankfully the dermatologist was
8N0IZZpF8ts,2408,00:44:23.240,00:44:23.250,thing thankfully the dermatologist was
8N0IZZpF8ts,2409,00:44:23.250,00:44:25.920,thing thankfully the dermatologist was very clear about that and said that this
8N0IZZpF8ts,2410,00:44:25.920,00:44:25.930,very clear about that and said that this
8N0IZZpF8ts,2411,00:44:25.930,00:44:27.150,very clear about that and said that this is a partial biopsy have a large
8N0IZZpF8ts,2412,00:44:27.150,00:44:27.160,is a partial biopsy have a large
8N0IZZpF8ts,2413,00:44:27.160,00:44:29.700,is a partial biopsy have a large worrisome lesion and here you can see
8N0IZZpF8ts,2414,00:44:29.700,00:44:29.710,worrisome lesion and here you can see
8N0IZZpF8ts,2415,00:44:29.710,00:44:31.050,worrisome lesion and here you can see one little fragment of epidermis but
8N0IZZpF8ts,2416,00:44:31.050,00:44:31.060,one little fragment of epidermis but
8N0IZZpF8ts,2417,00:44:31.060,00:44:33.270,one little fragment of epidermis but it's totally detached so it's hard to
8N0IZZpF8ts,2418,00:44:33.270,00:44:33.280,it's totally detached so it's hard to
8N0IZZpF8ts,2419,00:44:33.280,00:44:34.770,it's totally detached so it's hard to evaluate I'm only an aesthetic lesion
8N0IZZpF8ts,2420,00:44:34.770,00:44:34.780,evaluate I'm only an aesthetic lesion
8N0IZZpF8ts,2421,00:44:34.780,00:44:36.660,evaluate I'm only an aesthetic lesion when the whole epidermis is gone right
8N0IZZpF8ts,2422,00:44:36.660,00:44:36.670,when the whole epidermis is gone right
8N0IZZpF8ts,2423,00:44:36.670,00:44:38.010,when the whole epidermis is gone right because I can't look for Paget
8N0IZZpF8ts,2424,00:44:38.010,00:44:38.020,because I can't look for Paget
8N0IZZpF8ts,2425,00:44:38.020,00:44:39.540,because I can't look for Paget widespread really I can't look for
8N0IZZpF8ts,2426,00:44:39.540,00:44:39.550,widespread really I can't look for
8N0IZZpF8ts,2427,00:44:39.550,00:44:41.970,widespread really I can't look for confluent growth but wouldn't I see on a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2428,00:44:41.970,00:44:41.980,confluent growth but wouldn't I see on a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2429,00:44:41.980,00:44:44.310,confluent growth but wouldn't I see on a typical mistake lesion if then this is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2430,00:44:44.310,00:44:44.320,typical mistake lesion if then this is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2431,00:44:44.320,00:44:45.990,typical mistake lesion if then this is not a common finding but when I see
8N0IZZpF8ts,2432,00:44:45.990,00:44:46.000,not a common finding but when I see
8N0IZZpF8ts,2433,00:44:46.000,00:44:47.490,not a common finding but when I see something like this that instantly
8N0IZZpF8ts,2434,00:44:47.490,00:44:47.500,something like this that instantly
8N0IZZpF8ts,2435,00:44:47.500,00:44:49.290,something like this that instantly worries me that maybe there's confluent
8N0IZZpF8ts,2436,00:44:49.290,00:44:49.300,worries me that maybe there's confluent
8N0IZZpF8ts,2437,00:44:49.300,00:44:50.940,worries me that maybe there's confluent growth that's so confluent that the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2438,00:44:50.940,00:44:50.950,growth that's so confluent that the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2439,00:44:50.950,00:44:52.470,growth that's so confluent that the whole epidermis has artefactual II
8N0IZZpF8ts,2440,00:44:52.470,00:44:52.480,whole epidermis has artefactual II
8N0IZZpF8ts,2441,00:44:52.480,00:44:54.890,whole epidermis has artefactual II detached during processing of the tissue
8N0IZZpF8ts,2442,00:44:54.890,00:44:54.900,detached during processing of the tissue
8N0IZZpF8ts,2443,00:44:54.900,00:45:00.000,detached during processing of the tissue and is floated away and look we can see
8N0IZZpF8ts,2444,00:45:00.000,00:45:00.010,and is floated away and look we can see
8N0IZZpF8ts,2445,00:45:00.010,00:45:01.590,and is floated away and look we can see a typical melanocytes right in this
8N0IZZpF8ts,2446,00:45:01.590,00:45:01.600,a typical melanocytes right in this
8N0IZZpF8ts,2447,00:45:01.600,00:45:03.810,a typical melanocytes right in this space where the basal layer would have
8N0IZZpF8ts,2448,00:45:03.810,00:45:03.820,space where the basal layer would have
8N0IZZpF8ts,2449,00:45:03.820,00:45:05.880,space where the basal layer would have been but we just can't see any epidermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,2450,00:45:05.880,00:45:05.890,been but we just can't see any epidermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,2451,00:45:05.890,00:45:07.830,been but we just can't see any epidermis with it certainly the cytologic there's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2452,00:45:07.830,00:45:07.840,with it certainly the cytologic there's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2453,00:45:07.840,00:45:09.510,with it certainly the cytologic there's cytologic atypia down in the dermal
8N0IZZpF8ts,2454,00:45:09.510,00:45:09.520,cytologic atypia down in the dermal
8N0IZZpF8ts,2455,00:45:09.520,00:45:13.770,cytologic atypia down in the dermal component to some degree but the cells
8N0IZZpF8ts,2456,00:45:13.770,00:45:13.780,component to some degree but the cells
8N0IZZpF8ts,2457,00:45:13.780,00:45:15.270,component to some degree but the cells also kind of have a little bit of an e
8N0IZZpF8ts,2458,00:45:15.270,00:45:15.280,also kind of have a little bit of an e
8N0IZZpF8ts,2459,00:45:15.280,00:45:17.430,also kind of have a little bit of an e void appearance I kind of have an e this
8N0IZZpF8ts,2460,00:45:17.430,00:45:17.440,void appearance I kind of have an e this
8N0IZZpF8ts,2461,00:45:17.440,00:45:19.020,void appearance I kind of have an e this like look so it could be really
8N0IZZpF8ts,2462,00:45:19.020,00:45:19.030,like look so it could be really
8N0IZZpF8ts,2463,00:45:19.030,00:45:20.430,like look so it could be really challenging and here it matters because
8N0IZZpF8ts,2464,00:45:20.430,00:45:20.440,challenging and here it matters because
8N0IZZpF8ts,2465,00:45:20.440,00:45:21.960,challenging and here it matters because look how thick this lesion is it goes
8N0IZZpF8ts,2466,00:45:21.960,00:45:21.970,look how thick this lesion is it goes
8N0IZZpF8ts,2467,00:45:21.970,00:45:23.790,look how thick this lesion is it goes down into the dermis so if this is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2468,00:45:23.790,00:45:23.800,down into the dermis so if this is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2469,00:45:23.800,00:45:25.560,down into the dermis so if this is melanoma versus iniba sets a big
8N0IZZpF8ts,2470,00:45:25.560,00:45:25.570,melanoma versus iniba sets a big
8N0IZZpF8ts,2471,00:45:25.570,00:45:27.630,melanoma versus iniba sets a big difference for the patient here look
8N0IZZpF8ts,2472,00:45:27.630,00:45:27.640,difference for the patient here look
8N0IZZpF8ts,2473,00:45:27.640,00:45:32.740,difference for the patient here look what we have right here
8N0IZZpF8ts,2474,00:45:34.569,00:45:34.579,it's a little bit hard to see on this
8N0IZZpF8ts,2475,00:45:34.579,00:45:37.000,it's a little bit hard to see on this section but right here's a sweat duct
8N0IZZpF8ts,2476,00:45:37.000,00:45:37.010,section but right here's a sweat duct
8N0IZZpF8ts,2477,00:45:37.010,00:45:39.130,section but right here's a sweat duct and there's a little tiny lumen in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2478,00:45:39.130,00:45:39.140,and there's a little tiny lumen in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2479,00:45:39.140,00:45:41.380,and there's a little tiny lumen in the middle and if I did a keratin stain
8N0IZZpF8ts,2480,00:45:41.380,00:45:41.390,middle and if I did a keratin stain
8N0IZZpF8ts,2481,00:45:41.390,00:45:42.940,middle and if I did a keratin stain those cells in the center would stain
8N0IZZpF8ts,2482,00:45:42.940,00:45:42.950,those cells in the center would stain
8N0IZZpF8ts,2483,00:45:42.950,00:45:45.760,those cells in the center would stain and around the outside we have complete
8N0IZZpF8ts,2484,00:45:45.760,00:45:45.770,and around the outside we have complete
8N0IZZpF8ts,2485,00:45:45.770,00:45:48.150,and around the outside we have complete wrapping of the duct with very atypical
8N0IZZpF8ts,2486,00:45:48.150,00:45:48.160,wrapping of the duct with very atypical
8N0IZZpF8ts,2487,00:45:48.160,00:45:51.370,wrapping of the duct with very atypical melanocytes so this is confluent growth
8N0IZZpF8ts,2488,00:45:51.370,00:45:51.380,melanocytes so this is confluent growth
8N0IZZpF8ts,2489,00:45:51.380,00:45:53.770,melanocytes so this is confluent growth all the way down and we're way down in
8N0IZZpF8ts,2490,00:45:53.770,00:45:53.780,all the way down and we're way down in
8N0IZZpF8ts,2491,00:45:53.780,00:45:56.050,all the way down and we're way down in the dermis look at this it's really
8N0IZZpF8ts,2492,00:45:56.050,00:45:56.060,the dermis look at this it's really
8N0IZZpF8ts,2493,00:45:56.060,00:45:58.300,the dermis look at this it's really amazing to me how acryl melanomas tend
8N0IZZpF8ts,2494,00:45:58.300,00:45:58.310,amazing to me how acryl melanomas tend
8N0IZZpF8ts,2495,00:45:58.310,00:46:01.030,amazing to me how acryl melanomas tend to do this we're way down here and we
8N0IZZpF8ts,2496,00:46:01.030,00:46:01.040,to do this we're way down here and we
8N0IZZpF8ts,2497,00:46:01.040,00:46:02.829,to do this we're way down here and we have actually this is not invasive but
8N0IZZpF8ts,2498,00:46:02.829,00:46:02.839,have actually this is not invasive but
8N0IZZpF8ts,2499,00:46:02.839,00:46:06.309,have actually this is not invasive but melanoma insight to within the sweat
8N0IZZpF8ts,2500,00:46:06.309,00:46:06.319,melanoma insight to within the sweat
8N0IZZpF8ts,2501,00:46:06.319,00:46:08.920,melanoma insight to within the sweat duct empathy Liam so here that actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,2502,00:46:08.920,00:46:08.930,duct empathy Liam so here that actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,2503,00:46:08.930,00:46:10.690,duct empathy Liam so here that actually is a feature that would really be
8N0IZZpF8ts,2504,00:46:10.690,00:46:10.700,is a feature that would really be
8N0IZZpF8ts,2505,00:46:10.700,00:46:13.030,is a feature that would really be helpful and confirming the diagnosis but
8N0IZZpF8ts,2506,00:46:13.030,00:46:13.040,helpful and confirming the diagnosis but
8N0IZZpF8ts,2507,00:46:13.040,00:46:14.500,helpful and confirming the diagnosis but look the other piece actually shows us
8N0IZZpF8ts,2508,00:46:14.500,00:46:14.510,look the other piece actually shows us
8N0IZZpF8ts,2509,00:46:14.510,00:46:16.180,look the other piece actually shows us that what we suspect that is exactly
8N0IZZpF8ts,2510,00:46:16.180,00:46:16.190,that what we suspect that is exactly
8N0IZZpF8ts,2511,00:46:16.190,00:46:18.370,that what we suspect that is exactly what's happening here is the Malayan
8N0IZZpF8ts,2512,00:46:18.370,00:46:18.380,what's happening here is the Malayan
8N0IZZpF8ts,2513,00:46:18.380,00:46:20.440,what's happening here is the Malayan acidic lesion and you can see this cleft
8N0IZZpF8ts,2514,00:46:20.440,00:46:20.450,acidic lesion and you can see this cleft
8N0IZZpF8ts,2515,00:46:20.450,00:46:22.720,acidic lesion and you can see this cleft this split the blister here which is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2516,00:46:22.720,00:46:22.730,this split the blister here which is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2517,00:46:22.730,00:46:25.089,this split the blister here which is artefactual from the confluent growth of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2518,00:46:25.089,00:46:25.099,artefactual from the confluent growth of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2519,00:46:25.099,00:46:27.280,artefactual from the confluent growth of melanocytes along the dermal epidermal
8N0IZZpF8ts,2520,00:46:27.280,00:46:27.290,melanocytes along the dermal epidermal
8N0IZZpF8ts,2521,00:46:27.290,00:46:29.980,melanocytes along the dermal epidermal Junction and there is cytologic atypia
8N0IZZpF8ts,2522,00:46:29.980,00:46:29.990,Junction and there is cytologic atypia
8N0IZZpF8ts,2523,00:46:29.990,00:46:32.589,Junction and there is cytologic atypia there really hyper chromatic atypical
8N0IZZpF8ts,2524,00:46:32.589,00:46:32.599,there really hyper chromatic atypical
8N0IZZpF8ts,2525,00:46:32.599,00:46:35.020,there really hyper chromatic atypical melanocytes and there's Paget widespread
8N0IZZpF8ts,2526,00:46:35.020,00:46:35.030,melanocytes and there's Paget widespread
8N0IZZpF8ts,2527,00:46:35.030,00:46:37.960,melanocytes and there's Paget widespread lots of Paget widespread and if we look
8N0IZZpF8ts,2528,00:46:37.960,00:46:37.970,lots of Paget widespread and if we look
8N0IZZpF8ts,2529,00:46:37.970,00:46:43.569,lots of Paget widespread and if we look over here to the side this area is not
8N0IZZpF8ts,2530,00:46:43.569,00:46:43.579,over here to the side this area is not
8N0IZZpF8ts,2531,00:46:43.579,00:46:45.250,over here to the side this area is not quite as dramatic but we do begin to see
8N0IZZpF8ts,2532,00:46:45.250,00:46:45.260,quite as dramatic but we do begin to see
8N0IZZpF8ts,2533,00:46:45.260,00:46:48.099,quite as dramatic but we do begin to see some single cells moving up in the inner
8N0IZZpF8ts,2534,00:46:48.099,00:46:48.109,some single cells moving up in the inner
8N0IZZpF8ts,2535,00:46:48.109,00:46:50.230,some single cells moving up in the inner ridi space along the basal layer in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2536,00:46:50.230,00:46:50.240,ridi space along the basal layer in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2537,00:46:50.240,00:46:54.790,ridi space along the basal layer in the space between Reedy ridges and look what
8N0IZZpF8ts,2538,00:46:54.790,00:46:54.800,space between Reedy ridges and look what
8N0IZZpF8ts,2539,00:46:54.800,00:46:57.220,space between Reedy ridges and look what else we see here's an acro syringe ium
8N0IZZpF8ts,2540,00:46:57.220,00:46:57.230,else we see here's an acro syringe ium
8N0IZZpF8ts,2541,00:46:57.230,00:46:59.920,else we see here's an acro syringe ium this is the the swirly spirally opening
8N0IZZpF8ts,2542,00:46:59.920,00:46:59.930,this is the the swirly spirally opening
8N0IZZpF8ts,2543,00:46:59.930,00:47:02.859,this is the the swirly spirally opening of where the eccrine duct deposits sweat
8N0IZZpF8ts,2544,00:47:02.859,00:47:02.869,of where the eccrine duct deposits sweat
8N0IZZpF8ts,2545,00:47:02.869,00:47:04.870,of where the eccrine duct deposits sweat out onto the skin surface and there it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2546,00:47:04.870,00:47:04.880,out onto the skin surface and there it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2547,00:47:04.880,00:47:06.760,out onto the skin surface and there it's the best place to see them as a natural
8N0IZZpF8ts,2548,00:47:06.760,00:47:06.770,the best place to see them as a natural
8N0IZZpF8ts,2549,00:47:06.770,00:47:08.319,the best place to see them as a natural skin they're really dramatic there and
8N0IZZpF8ts,2550,00:47:08.319,00:47:08.329,skin they're really dramatic there and
8N0IZZpF8ts,2551,00:47:08.329,00:47:10.930,skin they're really dramatic there and look what we have right below it we have
8N0IZZpF8ts,2552,00:47:10.930,00:47:10.940,look what we have right below it we have
8N0IZZpF8ts,2553,00:47:10.940,00:47:12.880,look what we have right below it we have the sweat duct here's the lumen of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2554,00:47:12.880,00:47:12.890,the sweat duct here's the lumen of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2555,00:47:12.890,00:47:15.190,the sweat duct here's the lumen of the duct right here it's got a little hole

8N0IZZpF8ts,2561,00:47:19.280,00:47:22.240,what's this all melanoma cells completely replacing the basal layer and
8N0IZZpF8ts,2562,00:47:22.240,00:47:22.250,completely replacing the basal layer and
8N0IZZpF8ts,2563,00:47:22.250,00:47:24.220,completely replacing the basal layer and most of the epithelium of the sweat duct
8N0IZZpF8ts,2564,00:47:24.220,00:47:24.230,most of the epithelium of the sweat duct
8N0IZZpF8ts,2565,00:47:24.230,00:47:26.290,most of the epithelium of the sweat duct so this is what what we saw on the other
8N0IZZpF8ts,2566,00:47:26.290,00:47:26.300,so this is what what we saw on the other
8N0IZZpF8ts,2567,00:47:26.300,00:47:27.790,so this is what what we saw on the other piece this is what it looks like up at
8N0IZZpF8ts,2568,00:47:27.790,00:47:27.800,piece this is what it looks like up at
8N0IZZpF8ts,2569,00:47:27.800,00:47:29.740,piece this is what it looks like up at the top the cells have tracked all the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2570,00:47:29.740,00:47:29.750,the top the cells have tracked all the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2571,00:47:29.750,00:47:31.569,the top the cells have tracked all the way down that duct way down into the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2572,00:47:31.569,00:47:31.579,way down that duct way down into the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2573,00:47:31.579,00:47:34.270,way down that duct way down into the deep dermis and so again finding that is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2574,00:47:34.270,00:47:34.280,deep dermis and so again finding that is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2575,00:47:34.280,00:47:37.240,deep dermis and so again finding that is a really helpful clue for melanoma so
8N0IZZpF8ts,2576,00:47:37.240,00:47:37.250,a really helpful clue for melanoma so
8N0IZZpF8ts,2577,00:47:37.250,00:47:41.979,a really helpful clue for melanoma so all of this here is invasive melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,2578,00:47:44.569,00:47:44.579,and I've even occasionally I don't think
8N0IZZpF8ts,2579,00:47:44.579,00:47:45.829,and I've even occasionally I don't think this case has but I've even occasionally
8N0IZZpF8ts,2580,00:47:45.829,00:47:45.839,this case has but I've even occasionally
8N0IZZpF8ts,2581,00:47:45.839,00:47:47.299,this case has but I've even occasionally seen melanoma insight 2 all the way down
8N0IZZpF8ts,2582,00:47:47.299,00:47:47.309,seen melanoma insight 2 all the way down
8N0IZZpF8ts,2583,00:47:47.309,00:47:49.430,seen melanoma insight 2 all the way down into ekron coils way down and it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2584,00:47:49.430,00:47:49.440,into ekron coils way down and it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2585,00:47:49.440,00:47:50.959,into ekron coils way down and it's important again to recognize if it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2586,00:47:50.959,00:47:50.969,important again to recognize if it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2587,00:47:50.969,00:47:53.089,important again to recognize if it's actually in the sweat ducts or glands
8N0IZZpF8ts,2588,00:47:53.089,00:47:53.099,actually in the sweat ducts or glands
8N0IZZpF8ts,2589,00:47:53.099,00:47:55.279,actually in the sweat ducts or glands that's in sight - that's not invasion
8N0IZZpF8ts,2590,00:47:55.279,00:47:55.289,that's in sight - that's not invasion
8N0IZZpF8ts,2591,00:47:55.289,00:47:56.660,that's in sight - that's not invasion you don't want to measure that okay that
8N0IZZpF8ts,2592,00:47:56.660,00:47:56.670,you don't want to measure that okay that
8N0IZZpF8ts,2593,00:47:56.670,00:47:58.789,you don't want to measure that okay that will give you a deeper breslow than is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2594,00:47:58.789,00:47:58.799,will give you a deeper breslow than is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2595,00:47:58.799,00:48:02.029,will give you a deeper breslow than is actually real here's an example again of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2596,00:48:02.029,00:48:02.039,actually real here's an example again of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2597,00:48:02.039,00:48:07.099,actually real here's an example again of complete separation of the epidermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,2598,00:48:07.099,00:48:07.109,complete separation of the epidermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,2599,00:48:07.109,00:48:09.229,complete separation of the epidermis from the dermis a complete looks like a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2600,00:48:09.229,00:48:09.239,from the dermis a complete looks like a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2601,00:48:09.239,00:48:11.420,from the dermis a complete looks like a sub-epidermal blister but it's all do
8N0IZZpF8ts,2602,00:48:11.420,00:48:11.430,sub-epidermal blister but it's all do
8N0IZZpF8ts,2603,00:48:11.430,00:48:13.249,sub-epidermal blister but it's all do it's an artifact due to that confluent
8N0IZZpF8ts,2604,00:48:13.249,00:48:13.259,it's an artifact due to that confluent
8N0IZZpF8ts,2605,00:48:13.259,00:48:14.299,it's an artifact due to that confluent melanocytes
8N0IZZpF8ts,2606,00:48:14.299,00:48:14.309,melanocytes
8N0IZZpF8ts,2607,00:48:14.309,00:48:20.870,melanocytes a typical melanocytes in the dermis and
8N0IZZpF8ts,2608,00:48:20.870,00:48:20.880,a typical melanocytes in the dermis and
8N0IZZpF8ts,2609,00:48:20.880,00:48:22.579,a typical melanocytes in the dermis and this is the one where we have dramatic
8N0IZZpF8ts,2610,00:48:22.579,00:48:22.589,this is the one where we have dramatic
8N0IZZpF8ts,2611,00:48:22.589,00:48:25.219,this is the one where we have dramatic insight to melanoma all the way down
8N0IZZpF8ts,2612,00:48:25.219,00:48:25.229,insight to melanoma all the way down
8N0IZZpF8ts,2613,00:48:25.229,00:48:27.440,insight to melanoma all the way down here here's the duct cut kind of at a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2614,00:48:27.440,00:48:27.450,here here's the duct cut kind of at a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2615,00:48:27.450,00:48:28.910,here here's the duct cut kind of at a funny angle so that's why it looks like
8N0IZZpF8ts,2616,00:48:28.910,00:48:28.920,funny angle so that's why it looks like
8N0IZZpF8ts,2617,00:48:28.920,00:48:30.469,funny angle so that's why it looks like it's got little septation there it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2618,00:48:30.469,00:48:30.479,it's got little septation there it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2619,00:48:30.479,00:48:32.420,it's got little septation there it's actually just a swirly kind of spiral of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2620,00:48:32.420,00:48:32.430,actually just a swirly kind of spiral of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2621,00:48:32.430,00:48:34.549,actually just a swirly kind of spiral of the duct that's cut funny all of this is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2622,00:48:34.549,00:48:34.559,the duct that's cut funny all of this is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2623,00:48:34.559,00:48:36.949,the duct that's cut funny all of this is melanoma insight to replacing it and in
8N0IZZpF8ts,2624,00:48:36.949,00:48:36.959,melanoma insight to replacing it and in
8N0IZZpF8ts,2625,00:48:36.959,00:48:38.089,melanoma insight to replacing it and in this case is a little odd that in
8N0IZZpF8ts,2626,00:48:38.089,00:48:38.099,this case is a little odd that in
8N0IZZpF8ts,2627,00:48:38.099,00:48:39.410,this case is a little odd that in addition to melanoma it's likely there
8N0IZZpF8ts,2628,00:48:39.410,00:48:39.420,addition to melanoma it's likely there
8N0IZZpF8ts,2629,00:48:39.420,00:48:41.180,addition to melanoma it's likely there actually are single cells of invasive
8N0IZZpF8ts,2630,00:48:41.180,00:48:41.190,actually are single cells of invasive
8N0IZZpF8ts,2631,00:48:41.190,00:48:43.339,actually are single cells of invasive melanoma that have also tracked along
8N0IZZpF8ts,2632,00:48:43.339,00:48:43.349,melanoma that have also tracked along
8N0IZZpF8ts,2633,00:48:43.349,00:48:44.690,melanoma that have also tracked along the duct out in the dermis though
8N0IZZpF8ts,2634,00:48:44.690,00:48:44.700,the duct out in the dermis though
8N0IZZpF8ts,2635,00:48:44.700,00:48:46.729,the duct out in the dermis though they're out in the dermis so outside of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2636,00:48:46.729,00:48:46.739,they're out in the dermis so outside of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2637,00:48:46.739,00:48:48.769,they're out in the dermis so outside of the the epithelium so there's both
8N0IZZpF8ts,2638,00:48:48.769,00:48:48.779,the the epithelium so there's both
8N0IZZpF8ts,2639,00:48:48.779,00:48:50.749,the the epithelium so there's both insight to an invasive melanoma around
8N0IZZpF8ts,2640,00:48:50.749,00:48:50.759,insight to an invasive melanoma around
8N0IZZpF8ts,2641,00:48:50.759,00:48:52.759,insight to an invasive melanoma around these ducts which is kind of weird but
8N0IZZpF8ts,2642,00:48:52.759,00:48:52.769,these ducts which is kind of weird but
8N0IZZpF8ts,2643,00:48:52.769,00:48:54.920,these ducts which is kind of weird but it's a really really great example
8N0IZZpF8ts,2644,00:48:54.920,00:48:54.930,it's a really really great example
8N0IZZpF8ts,2645,00:48:54.930,00:48:57.319,it's a really really great example though of how dramatically you can have
8N0IZZpF8ts,2646,00:48:57.319,00:48:57.329,though of how dramatically you can have
8N0IZZpF8ts,2647,00:48:57.329,00:48:58.910,though of how dramatically you can have melanoma in sites you spread down ducks
8N0IZZpF8ts,2648,00:48:58.910,00:48:58.920,melanoma in sites you spread down ducks
8N0IZZpF8ts,2649,00:48:58.920,00:49:00.739,melanoma in sites you spread down ducks in a confluent fashion and that can
8N0IZZpF8ts,2650,00:49:00.739,00:49:00.749,in a confluent fashion and that can
8N0IZZpF8ts,2651,00:49:00.749,00:49:01.939,in a confluent fashion and that can really help make the diagnosis of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2652,00:49:01.939,00:49:01.949,really help make the diagnosis of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2653,00:49:01.949,00:49:05.029,really help make the diagnosis of melanoma in challenging cases so breslow
8N0IZZpF8ts,2654,00:49:05.029,00:49:05.039,melanoma in challenging cases so breslow
8N0IZZpF8ts,2655,00:49:05.039,00:49:07.309,melanoma in challenging cases so breslow depth is normally measured the way we
8N0IZZpF8ts,2656,00:49:07.309,00:49:07.319,depth is normally measured the way we
8N0IZZpF8ts,2657,00:49:07.319,00:49:09.410,depth is normally measured the way we measure it is we measure from the top of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2658,00:49:09.410,00:49:09.420,measure it is we measure from the top of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2659,00:49:09.420,00:49:11.539,measure it is we measure from the top of the granular layer so not the top of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2660,00:49:11.539,00:49:11.549,the granular layer so not the top of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2661,00:49:11.549,00:49:13.069,the granular layer so not the top of the corneal layer but the top of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2662,00:49:13.069,00:49:13.079,corneal layer but the top of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2663,00:49:13.079,00:49:15.170,corneal layer but the top of the granular layer and we measure all the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2664,00:49:15.170,00:49:15.180,granular layer and we measure all the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2665,00:49:15.180,00:49:16.969,granular layer and we measure all the way down to the deepest part of melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,2666,00:49:16.969,00:49:16.979,way down to the deepest part of melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,2667,00:49:16.979,00:49:18.859,way down to the deepest part of melanoma so we'd start here and we measure down
8N0IZZpF8ts,2668,00:49:18.859,00:49:18.869,so we'd start here and we measure down
8N0IZZpF8ts,2669,00:49:18.869,00:49:20.689,so we'd start here and we measure down here and usually we have an eyepiece
8N0IZZpF8ts,2670,00:49:20.689,00:49:20.699,here and usually we have an eyepiece
8N0IZZpF8ts,2671,00:49:20.699,00:49:22.099,here and usually we have an eyepiece that you can't see on the screen but
8N0IZZpF8ts,2672,00:49:22.099,00:49:22.109,that you can't see on the screen but
8N0IZZpF8ts,2673,00:49:22.109,00:49:23.749,that you can't see on the screen but that we can see here sitting at the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2674,00:49:23.749,00:49:23.759,that we can see here sitting at the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2675,00:49:23.759,00:49:26.689,that we can see here sitting at the microscope it's a micrometer and in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2676,00:49:26.689,00:49:26.699,microscope it's a micrometer and in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2677,00:49:26.699,00:49:28.189,microscope it's a micrometer and in the ocular of the microscope that lets us
8N0IZZpF8ts,2678,00:49:28.189,00:49:28.199,ocular of the microscope that lets us
8N0IZZpF8ts,2679,00:49:28.199,00:49:30.109,ocular of the microscope that lets us measure and we report it in millimeters
8N0IZZpF8ts,2680,00:49:30.109,00:49:30.119,measure and we report it in millimeters
8N0IZZpF8ts,2681,00:49:30.119,00:49:32.239,measure and we report it in millimeters and in a case like this where there's an
8N0IZZpF8ts,2682,00:49:32.239,00:49:32.249,and in a case like this where there's an
8N0IZZpF8ts,2683,00:49:32.249,00:49:33.890,and in a case like this where there's an artifact xual split I would make a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2684,00:49:33.890,00:49:33.900,artifact xual split I would make a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2685,00:49:33.900,00:49:37.309,artifact xual split I would make a measurement from here to here and I
8N0IZZpF8ts,2686,00:49:37.309,00:49:37.319,measurement from here to here and I
8N0IZZpF8ts,2687,00:49:37.319,00:49:38.870,measurement from here to here and I might measure several areas this area
8N0IZZpF8ts,2688,00:49:38.870,00:49:38.880,might measure several areas this area
8N0IZZpF8ts,2689,00:49:38.880,00:49:40.219,might measure several areas this area over here actually is probably deeper
8N0IZZpF8ts,2690,00:49:40.219,00:49:40.229,over here actually is probably deeper
8N0IZZpF8ts,2691,00:49:40.229,00:49:42.620,over here actually is probably deeper and in fact since we had stuff down deep
8N0IZZpF8ts,2692,00:49:42.620,00:49:42.630,and in fact since we had stuff down deep
8N0IZZpF8ts,2693,00:49:42.630,00:49:44.390,and in fact since we had stuff down deep we probably could measure all the way
8N0IZZpF8ts,2694,00:49:44.390,00:49:44.400,we probably could measure all the way
8N0IZZpF8ts,2695,00:49:44.400,00:49:45.289,we probably could measure all the way here but that's a little bit more
8N0IZZpF8ts,2696,00:49:45.289,00:49:45.299,here but that's a little bit more
8N0IZZpF8ts,2697,00:49:45.299,00:49:47.089,here but that's a little bit more complicated just for the point of it say
8N0IZZpF8ts,2698,00:49:47.089,00:49:47.099,complicated just for the point of it say
8N0IZZpF8ts,2699,00:49:47.099,00:49:48.469,complicated just for the point of it say this was the deepest part of the lesion
8N0IZZpF8ts,2700,00:49:48.469,00:49:48.479,this was the deepest part of the lesion
8N0IZZpF8ts,2701,00:49:48.479,00:49:50.689,this was the deepest part of the lesion you would start at the granule layer you
8N0IZZpF8ts,2702,00:49:50.689,00:49:50.699,you would start at the granule layer you
8N0IZZpF8ts,2703,00:49:50.699,00:49:52.219,you would start at the granule layer you would go down to the deepest place in
8N0IZZpF8ts,2704,00:49:52.219,00:49:52.229,would go down to the deepest place in
8N0IZZpF8ts,2705,00:49:52.229,00:49:53.390,would go down to the deepest place in the lesion and if
8N0IZZpF8ts,2706,00:49:53.390,00:49:53.400,the lesion and if
8N0IZZpF8ts,2707,00:49:53.400,00:49:54.740,the lesion and if have an artifact like this a little
8N0IZZpF8ts,2708,00:49:54.740,00:49:54.750,have an artifact like this a little
8N0IZZpF8ts,2709,00:49:54.750,00:49:56.360,have an artifact like this a little split subtract that amount out because
8N0IZZpF8ts,2710,00:49:56.360,00:49:56.370,split subtract that amount out because
8N0IZZpF8ts,2711,00:49:56.370,00:49:57.800,split subtract that amount out because that's not really there in the patient
8N0IZZpF8ts,2712,00:49:57.800,00:49:57.810,that's not really there in the patient
8N0IZZpF8ts,2713,00:49:57.810,00:49:59.420,that's not really there in the patient so if there's that might be a little a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2714,00:49:59.420,00:49:59.430,so if there's that might be a little a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2715,00:49:59.430,00:50:01.280,so if there's that might be a little a little tiny area that it won't really
8N0IZZpF8ts,2716,00:50:01.280,00:50:01.290,little tiny area that it won't really
8N0IZZpF8ts,2717,00:50:01.290,00:50:03.140,little tiny area that it won't really change much but I usually will subtract
8N0IZZpF8ts,2718,00:50:03.140,00:50:03.150,change much but I usually will subtract
8N0IZZpF8ts,2719,00:50:03.150,00:50:04.370,change much but I usually will subtract that out if there's an artifact like
8N0IZZpF8ts,2720,00:50:04.370,00:50:04.380,that out if there's an artifact like
8N0IZZpF8ts,2721,00:50:04.380,00:50:06.380,that out if there's an artifact like that okay so you measure from the top of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2722,00:50:06.380,00:50:06.390,that okay so you measure from the top of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2723,00:50:06.390,00:50:07.670,that okay so you measure from the top of the granule layer to the deepest point
8N0IZZpF8ts,2724,00:50:07.670,00:50:07.680,the granule layer to the deepest point
8N0IZZpF8ts,2725,00:50:07.680,00:50:09.860,the granule layer to the deepest point of invasion and again stuff like this is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2726,00:50:09.860,00:50:09.870,of invasion and again stuff like this is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2727,00:50:09.870,00:50:11.630,of invasion and again stuff like this is not usually seen in melanoma it's kind
8N0IZZpF8ts,2728,00:50:11.630,00:50:11.640,not usually seen in melanoma it's kind
8N0IZZpF8ts,2729,00:50:11.640,00:50:12.980,not usually seen in melanoma it's kind of complicated so we won't really go
8N0IZZpF8ts,2730,00:50:12.980,00:50:12.990,of complicated so we won't really go
8N0IZZpF8ts,2731,00:50:12.990,00:50:15.290,of complicated so we won't really go into how to deal with that all right but
8N0IZZpF8ts,2732,00:50:15.290,00:50:15.300,into how to deal with that all right but
8N0IZZpF8ts,2733,00:50:15.300,00:50:17.420,into how to deal with that all right but anyway that's the basics of breslow
8N0IZZpF8ts,2734,00:50:17.420,00:50:17.430,anyway that's the basics of breslow
8N0IZZpF8ts,2735,00:50:17.430,00:50:20.440,anyway that's the basics of breslow that's the basics of confluent growth a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2736,00:50:20.440,00:50:20.450,that's the basics of confluent growth a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2737,00:50:20.450,00:50:27.140,that's the basics of confluent growth a really good example now this is changing
8N0IZZpF8ts,2738,00:50:27.140,00:50:27.150,really good example now this is changing
8N0IZZpF8ts,2739,00:50:27.150,00:50:28.850,really good example now this is changing gears a little bit here we have a biopsy
8N0IZZpF8ts,2740,00:50:28.850,00:50:28.860,gears a little bit here we have a biopsy
8N0IZZpF8ts,2741,00:50:28.860,00:50:32.540,gears a little bit here we have a biopsy of a pigmented lesion from the face of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2742,00:50:32.540,00:50:32.550,of a pigmented lesion from the face of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2743,00:50:32.550,00:50:34.670,of a pigmented lesion from the face of an elderly person and you can tell it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2744,00:50:34.670,00:50:34.680,an elderly person and you can tell it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2745,00:50:34.680,00:50:35.810,an elderly person and you can tell it's probably the face because there's lots
8N0IZZpF8ts,2746,00:50:35.810,00:50:35.820,probably the face because there's lots
8N0IZZpF8ts,2747,00:50:35.820,00:50:38.540,probably the face because there's lots of large sebaceous glands and prominent
8N0IZZpF8ts,2748,00:50:38.540,00:50:38.550,of large sebaceous glands and prominent
8N0IZZpF8ts,2749,00:50:38.550,00:50:41.210,of large sebaceous glands and prominent hair follicles okay so as patients age
8N0IZZpF8ts,2750,00:50:41.210,00:50:41.220,hair follicles okay so as patients age
8N0IZZpF8ts,2751,00:50:41.220,00:50:43.070,hair follicles okay so as patients age they tend to get prominent sebaceous
8N0IZZpF8ts,2752,00:50:43.070,00:50:43.080,they tend to get prominent sebaceous
8N0IZZpF8ts,2753,00:50:43.080,00:50:44.690,they tend to get prominent sebaceous glands and sebaceous hyperplasia on
8N0IZZpF8ts,2754,00:50:44.690,00:50:44.700,glands and sebaceous hyperplasia on
8N0IZZpF8ts,2755,00:50:44.700,00:50:47.810,glands and sebaceous hyperplasia on their face but this is a dark lesion in
8N0IZZpF8ts,2756,00:50:47.810,00:50:47.820,their face but this is a dark lesion in
8N0IZZpF8ts,2757,00:50:47.820,00:50:50.330,their face but this is a dark lesion in the patient's old and sun-damaged okay
8N0IZZpF8ts,2758,00:50:50.330,00:50:50.340,the patient's old and sun-damaged okay
8N0IZZpF8ts,2759,00:50:50.340,00:50:52.940,the patient's old and sun-damaged okay so clinically they're concerned is this
8N0IZZpF8ts,2760,00:50:52.940,00:50:52.950,so clinically they're concerned is this
8N0IZZpF8ts,2761,00:50:52.950,00:50:55.760,so clinically they're concerned is this length ago or a seborrheic keratosis or
8N0IZZpF8ts,2762,00:50:55.760,00:50:55.770,length ago or a seborrheic keratosis or
8N0IZZpF8ts,2763,00:50:55.770,00:50:58.490,length ago or a seborrheic keratosis or is this an atypical nevis or is this a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2764,00:50:58.490,00:50:58.500,is this an atypical nevis or is this a
8N0IZZpF8ts,2765,00:50:58.500,00:51:01.550,is this an atypical nevis or is this a melanoma on the sun-damaged face of old
8N0IZZpF8ts,2766,00:51:01.550,00:51:01.560,melanoma on the sun-damaged face of old
8N0IZZpF8ts,2767,00:51:01.560,00:51:06.050,melanoma on the sun-damaged face of old people my my thought process is if I see
8N0IZZpF8ts,2768,00:51:06.050,00:51:06.060,people my my thought process is if I see
8N0IZZpF8ts,2769,00:51:06.060,00:51:08.180,people my my thought process is if I see melanocytes there I want to think about
8N0IZZpF8ts,2770,00:51:08.180,00:51:08.190,melanocytes there I want to think about
8N0IZZpF8ts,2771,00:51:08.190,00:51:10.130,melanocytes there I want to think about melanoma until I can prove that it's not
8N0IZZpF8ts,2772,00:51:10.130,00:51:10.140,melanoma until I can prove that it's not
8N0IZZpF8ts,2773,00:51:10.140,00:51:13.040,melanoma until I can prove that it's not it's not that you can't have me by on
8N0IZZpF8ts,2774,00:51:13.040,00:51:13.050,it's not that you can't have me by on
8N0IZZpF8ts,2775,00:51:13.050,00:51:14.960,it's not that you can't have me by on the face of old sun damage people you
8N0IZZpF8ts,2776,00:51:14.960,00:51:14.970,the face of old sun damage people you
8N0IZZpF8ts,2777,00:51:14.970,00:51:18.380,the face of old sun damage people you can but it's far more worrisome that I'm
8N0IZZpF8ts,2778,00:51:18.380,00:51:18.390,can but it's far more worrisome that I'm
8N0IZZpF8ts,2779,00:51:18.390,00:51:20.540,can but it's far more worrisome that I'm gonna miss a melanoma if I'm not being
8N0IZZpF8ts,2780,00:51:20.540,00:51:20.550,gonna miss a melanoma if I'm not being
8N0IZZpF8ts,2781,00:51:20.550,00:51:22.490,gonna miss a melanoma if I'm not being cautious because sometimes the melanomas
8N0IZZpF8ts,2782,00:51:22.490,00:51:22.500,cautious because sometimes the melanomas
8N0IZZpF8ts,2783,00:51:22.500,00:51:25.070,cautious because sometimes the melanomas that occur on sun damaged elderly skin
8N0IZZpF8ts,2784,00:51:25.070,00:51:25.080,that occur on sun damaged elderly skin
8N0IZZpF8ts,2785,00:51:25.080,00:51:26.480,that occur on sun damaged elderly skin particularly on the head and neck can be
8N0IZZpF8ts,2786,00:51:26.480,00:51:26.490,particularly on the head and neck can be
8N0IZZpF8ts,2787,00:51:26.490,00:51:28.790,particularly on the head and neck can be very subtle at first glance and so this
8N0IZZpF8ts,2788,00:51:28.790,00:51:28.800,very subtle at first glance and so this
8N0IZZpF8ts,2789,00:51:28.800,00:51:30.350,very subtle at first glance and so this type of melanoma is called leant to go
8N0IZZpF8ts,2790,00:51:30.350,00:51:30.360,type of melanoma is called leant to go
8N0IZZpF8ts,2791,00:51:30.360,00:51:32.900,type of melanoma is called leant to go it's called that because it
8N0IZZpF8ts,2792,00:51:32.900,00:51:32.910,it's called that because it
8N0IZZpF8ts,2793,00:51:32.910,00:51:34.400,it's called that because it looks a lot like solar Lent ago
8N0IZZpF8ts,2794,00:51:34.400,00:51:34.410,looks a lot like solar Lent ago
8N0IZZpF8ts,2795,00:51:34.410,00:51:37.220,looks a lot like solar Lent ago clinically but it behaves if you leave
8N0IZZpF8ts,2796,00:51:37.220,00:51:37.230,clinically but it behaves if you leave
8N0IZZpF8ts,2797,00:51:37.230,00:51:38.780,clinically but it behaves if you leave it alone for many years it will often
8N0IZZpF8ts,2798,00:51:38.780,00:51:38.790,it alone for many years it will often
8N0IZZpF8ts,2799,00:51:38.790,00:51:40.790,it alone for many years it will often behave badly sometimes it can can behave
8N0IZZpF8ts,2800,00:51:40.790,00:51:40.800,behave badly sometimes it can can behave
8N0IZZpF8ts,2801,00:51:40.800,00:51:43.220,behave badly sometimes it can can behave badly even more more rapidly but a lot
8N0IZZpF8ts,2802,00:51:43.220,00:51:43.230,badly even more more rapidly but a lot
8N0IZZpF8ts,2803,00:51:43.230,00:51:44.480,badly even more more rapidly but a lot of times it will grow for a long time
8N0IZZpF8ts,2804,00:51:44.480,00:51:44.490,of times it will grow for a long time
8N0IZZpF8ts,2805,00:51:44.490,00:51:47.870,of times it will grow for a long time and then eventually become aggressive so
8N0IZZpF8ts,2806,00:51:47.870,00:51:47.880,and then eventually become aggressive so
8N0IZZpF8ts,2807,00:51:47.880,00:51:49.430,and then eventually become aggressive so what we see in this case there's a lot
8N0IZZpF8ts,2808,00:51:49.430,00:51:49.440,what we see in this case there's a lot
8N0IZZpF8ts,2809,00:51:49.440,00:51:51.350,what we see in this case there's a lot of pigment right well solar lens ago
8N0IZZpF8ts,2810,00:51:51.350,00:51:51.360,of pigment right well solar lens ago
8N0IZZpF8ts,2811,00:51:51.360,00:51:52.610,of pigment right well solar lens ago would look like that too it can have
8N0IZZpF8ts,2812,00:51:52.610,00:51:52.620,would look like that too it can have
8N0IZZpF8ts,2813,00:51:52.620,00:51:55.040,would look like that too it can have elongated Reedy that are hyper pigmented
8N0IZZpF8ts,2814,00:51:55.040,00:51:55.050,elongated Reedy that are hyper pigmented
8N0IZZpF8ts,2815,00:51:55.050,00:51:57.410,elongated Reedy that are hyper pigmented so when you see these it's important to
8N0IZZpF8ts,2816,00:51:57.410,00:51:57.420,so when you see these it's important to
8N0IZZpF8ts,2817,00:51:57.420,00:51:59.180,so when you see these it's important to look a little more closely if you see
8N0IZZpF8ts,2818,00:51:59.180,00:51:59.190,look a little more closely if you see
8N0IZZpF8ts,2819,00:51:59.190,00:52:02.030,look a little more closely if you see nests or a significant number of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2820,00:52:02.030,00:52:02.040,nests or a significant number of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2821,00:52:02.040,00:52:04.160,nests or a significant number of atypical melanocytes you should be very
8N0IZZpF8ts,2822,00:52:04.160,00:52:04.170,atypical melanocytes you should be very
8N0IZZpF8ts,2823,00:52:04.170,00:52:05.859,atypical melanocytes you should be very worried about the possibility
8N0IZZpF8ts,2824,00:52:05.859,00:52:05.869,worried about the possibility
8N0IZZpF8ts,2825,00:52:05.869,00:52:07.900,worried about the possibility of melanoma insights UK Lent ago
8N0IZZpF8ts,2826,00:52:07.900,00:52:07.910,of melanoma insights UK Lent ago
8N0IZZpF8ts,2827,00:52:07.910,00:52:11.349,of melanoma insights UK Lent ago malignant and one thing that helps me is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2828,00:52:11.349,00:52:11.359,malignant and one thing that helps me is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2829,00:52:11.359,00:52:15.400,malignant and one thing that helps me is if I see this I see kind of a jumbling
8N0IZZpF8ts,2830,00:52:15.400,00:52:15.410,if I see this I see kind of a jumbling
8N0IZZpF8ts,2831,00:52:15.410,00:52:18.099,if I see this I see kind of a jumbling of grayish looking cells along the basal
8N0IZZpF8ts,2832,00:52:18.099,00:52:18.109,of grayish looking cells along the basal
8N0IZZpF8ts,2833,00:52:18.109,00:52:19.959,of grayish looking cells along the basal layer and it can be quite hard in cases
8N0IZZpF8ts,2834,00:52:19.959,00:52:19.969,layer and it can be quite hard in cases
8N0IZZpF8ts,2835,00:52:19.969,00:52:21.339,layer and it can be quite hard in cases that have a lot of pigment like this one
8N0IZZpF8ts,2836,00:52:21.339,00:52:21.349,that have a lot of pigment like this one
8N0IZZpF8ts,2837,00:52:21.349,00:52:22.870,that have a lot of pigment like this one but here when I start seeing an
8N0IZZpF8ts,2838,00:52:22.870,00:52:22.880,but here when I start seeing an
8N0IZZpF8ts,2839,00:52:22.880,00:52:24.309,but here when I start seeing an increased number of cells that are kind
8N0IZZpF8ts,2840,00:52:24.309,00:52:24.319,increased number of cells that are kind
8N0IZZpF8ts,2841,00:52:24.319,00:52:26.289,increased number of cells that are kind of large and of gray cytoplasm that
8N0IZZpF8ts,2842,00:52:26.289,00:52:26.299,of large and of gray cytoplasm that
8N0IZZpF8ts,2843,00:52:26.299,00:52:28.779,of large and of gray cytoplasm that worries me now if that's all I had here
8N0IZZpF8ts,2844,00:52:28.779,00:52:28.789,worries me now if that's all I had here
8N0IZZpF8ts,2845,00:52:28.789,00:52:30.339,worries me now if that's all I had here doing an immuno stain would be
8N0IZZpF8ts,2846,00:52:30.339,00:52:30.349,doing an immuno stain would be
8N0IZZpF8ts,2847,00:52:30.349,00:52:32.319,doing an immuno stain would be potentially very useful and I personally
8N0IZZpF8ts,2848,00:52:32.319,00:52:32.329,potentially very useful and I personally
8N0IZZpF8ts,2849,00:52:32.329,00:52:34.989,potentially very useful and I personally like to use sox10 and I like the red
8N0IZZpF8ts,2850,00:52:34.989,00:52:34.999,like to use sox10 and I like the red
8N0IZZpF8ts,2851,00:52:34.999,00:52:37.089,like to use sox10 and I like the red chromatin if you're able to have that
8N0IZZpF8ts,2852,00:52:37.089,00:52:37.099,chromatin if you're able to have that
8N0IZZpF8ts,2853,00:52:37.099,00:52:38.440,chromatin if you're able to have that because it will help you in cases like
8N0IZZpF8ts,2854,00:52:38.440,00:52:38.450,because it will help you in cases like
8N0IZZpF8ts,2855,00:52:38.450,00:52:39.999,because it will help you in cases like this where there's lots of brown pigment
8N0IZZpF8ts,2856,00:52:39.999,00:52:40.009,this where there's lots of brown pigment
8N0IZZpF8ts,2857,00:52:40.009,00:52:41.319,this where there's lots of brown pigment it'll help you to distinguish what's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2858,00:52:41.319,00:52:41.329,it'll help you to distinguish what's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2859,00:52:41.329,00:52:43.569,it'll help you to distinguish what's true staining of melanocytes nuclei
8N0IZZpF8ts,2860,00:52:43.569,00:52:43.579,true staining of melanocytes nuclei
8N0IZZpF8ts,2861,00:52:43.579,00:52:46.059,true staining of melanocytes nuclei versus background pigment okay but if
8N0IZZpF8ts,2862,00:52:46.059,00:52:46.069,versus background pigment okay but if
8N0IZZpF8ts,2863,00:52:46.069,00:52:48.390,versus background pigment okay but if you don't have that MIT f also works
8N0IZZpF8ts,2864,00:52:48.390,00:52:48.400,you don't have that MIT f also works
8N0IZZpF8ts,2865,00:52:48.400,00:52:51.039,you don't have that MIT f also works although I only personally like to use
8N0IZZpF8ts,2866,00:52:51.039,00:52:51.049,although I only personally like to use
8N0IZZpF8ts,2867,00:52:51.049,00:52:53.829,although I only personally like to use MIT F if for melanoma in situ and I
8N0IZZpF8ts,2868,00:52:53.829,00:52:53.839,MIT F if for melanoma in situ and I
8N0IZZpF8ts,2869,00:52:53.839,00:52:55.569,MIT F if for melanoma in situ and I don't ever like to use it for invasive
8N0IZZpF8ts,2870,00:52:55.569,00:52:55.579,don't ever like to use it for invasive
8N0IZZpF8ts,2871,00:52:55.579,00:52:57.249,don't ever like to use it for invasive melanoma or metastatic melanoma because
8N0IZZpF8ts,2872,00:52:57.249,00:52:57.259,melanoma or metastatic melanoma because
8N0IZZpF8ts,2873,00:52:57.259,00:52:58.900,melanoma or metastatic melanoma because it's relatively nonspecific in my
8N0IZZpF8ts,2874,00:52:58.900,00:52:58.910,it's relatively nonspecific in my
8N0IZZpF8ts,2875,00:52:58.910,00:53:00.099,it's relatively nonspecific in my experience it will often stain
8N0IZZpF8ts,2876,00:53:00.099,00:53:00.109,experience it will often stain
8N0IZZpF8ts,2877,00:53:00.109,00:53:02.890,experience it will often stain histiocytes so if you have MIT f I think
8N0IZZpF8ts,2878,00:53:02.890,00:53:02.900,histiocytes so if you have MIT f I think
8N0IZZpF8ts,2879,00:53:02.900,00:53:05.259,histiocytes so if you have MIT f I think it works okay for melanoma in situ but I
8N0IZZpF8ts,2880,00:53:05.259,00:53:05.269,it works okay for melanoma in situ but I
8N0IZZpF8ts,2881,00:53:05.269,00:53:07.420,it works okay for melanoma in situ but I don't like to use it for melanoma in any
8N0IZZpF8ts,2882,00:53:07.420,00:53:07.430,don't like to use it for melanoma in any
8N0IZZpF8ts,2883,00:53:07.430,00:53:09.700,don't like to use it for melanoma in any other context personally I think it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2884,00:53:09.700,00:53:09.710,other context personally I think it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,2885,00:53:09.710,00:53:11.440,other context personally I think it's actually kind of dangerous and to look
8N0IZZpF8ts,2886,00:53:11.440,00:53:11.450,actually kind of dangerous and to look
8N0IZZpF8ts,2887,00:53:11.450,00:53:13.150,actually kind of dangerous and to look at lymph nodes or distant Mets and try
8N0IZZpF8ts,2888,00:53:13.150,00:53:13.160,at lymph nodes or distant Mets and try
8N0IZZpF8ts,2889,00:53:13.160,00:53:16.269,at lymph nodes or distant Mets and try to use MIT F there so anyway we can have
8N0IZZpF8ts,2890,00:53:16.269,00:53:16.279,to use MIT F there so anyway we can have
8N0IZZpF8ts,2891,00:53:16.279,00:53:17.499,to use MIT F there so anyway we can have another video about mo Lian acidic
8N0IZZpF8ts,2892,00:53:17.499,00:53:17.509,another video about mo Lian acidic
8N0IZZpF8ts,2893,00:53:17.509,00:53:18.609,another video about mo Lian acidic immuno stains but I personally like
8N0IZZpF8ts,2894,00:53:18.609,00:53:18.619,immuno stains but I personally like
8N0IZZpF8ts,2895,00:53:18.619,00:53:21.489,immuno stains but I personally like sox10 Mart ones okay too but it will
8N0IZZpF8ts,2896,00:53:21.489,00:53:21.499,sox10 Mart ones okay too but it will
8N0IZZpF8ts,2897,00:53:21.499,00:53:23.380,sox10 Mart ones okay too but it will stain the the dendritic processes of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2898,00:53:23.380,00:53:23.390,stain the the dendritic processes of
8N0IZZpF8ts,2899,00:53:23.390,00:53:24.849,stain the the dendritic processes of melanocytes and it can tend to make you
8N0IZZpF8ts,2900,00:53:24.849,00:53:24.859,melanocytes and it can tend to make you
8N0IZZpF8ts,2901,00:53:24.859,00:53:26.680,melanocytes and it can tend to make you over-interpret how many melanocytes are
8N0IZZpF8ts,2902,00:53:26.680,00:53:26.690,over-interpret how many melanocytes are
8N0IZZpF8ts,2903,00:53:26.690,00:53:28.509,over-interpret how many melanocytes are there so see down here we're starting to
8N0IZZpF8ts,2904,00:53:28.509,00:53:28.519,there so see down here we're starting to
8N0IZZpF8ts,2905,00:53:28.519,00:53:30.309,there so see down here we're starting to see actually little clusters of single
8N0IZZpF8ts,2906,00:53:30.309,00:53:30.319,see actually little clusters of single
8N0IZZpF8ts,2907,00:53:30.319,00:53:31.630,see actually little clusters of single melanocytes even though they're darkly
8N0IZZpF8ts,2908,00:53:31.630,00:53:31.640,melanocytes even though they're darkly
8N0IZZpF8ts,2909,00:53:31.640,00:53:34.450,melanocytes even though they're darkly pigmented or blend it in with darkly
8N0IZZpF8ts,2910,00:53:34.450,00:53:34.460,pigmented or blend it in with darkly
8N0IZZpF8ts,2911,00:53:34.460,00:53:36.819,pigmented or blend it in with darkly pigmented keratinocytes there probably
8N0IZZpF8ts,2912,00:53:36.819,00:53:36.829,pigmented keratinocytes there probably
8N0IZZpF8ts,2913,00:53:36.829,00:53:39.430,pigmented keratinocytes there probably are melanocytes down here when an immuno
8N0IZZpF8ts,2914,00:53:39.430,00:53:39.440,are melanocytes down here when an immuno
8N0IZZpF8ts,2915,00:53:39.440,00:53:42.370,are melanocytes down here when an immuno stain indeed actually confirmed that you
8N0IZZpF8ts,2916,00:53:42.370,00:53:42.380,stain indeed actually confirmed that you
8N0IZZpF8ts,2917,00:53:42.380,00:53:43.390,stain indeed actually confirmed that you can see here we're starting to get
8N0IZZpF8ts,2918,00:53:43.390,00:53:43.400,can see here we're starting to get
8N0IZZpF8ts,2919,00:53:43.400,00:53:45.849,can see here we're starting to get little clusters so again what I'm
8N0IZZpF8ts,2920,00:53:45.849,00:53:45.859,little clusters so again what I'm
8N0IZZpF8ts,2921,00:53:45.859,00:53:47.709,little clusters so again what I'm showing you though on H and E here is is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2922,00:53:47.709,00:53:47.719,showing you though on H and E here is is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2923,00:53:47.719,00:53:50.049,showing you though on H and E here is is kind of challenging but the reason I'm
8N0IZZpF8ts,2924,00:53:50.049,00:53:50.059,kind of challenging but the reason I'm
8N0IZZpF8ts,2925,00:53:50.059,00:53:51.370,kind of challenging but the reason I'm going to show you this one is a so that
8N0IZZpF8ts,2926,00:53:51.370,00:53:51.380,going to show you this one is a so that
8N0IZZpF8ts,2927,00:53:51.380,00:53:53.289,going to show you this one is a so that you remember that lent ago malignant can
8N0IZZpF8ts,2928,00:53:53.289,00:53:53.299,you remember that lent ago malignant can
8N0IZZpF8ts,2929,00:53:53.299,00:53:55.180,you remember that lent ago malignant can be very subtle sometimes and hard to
8N0IZZpF8ts,2930,00:53:55.180,00:53:55.190,be very subtle sometimes and hard to
8N0IZZpF8ts,2931,00:53:55.190,00:53:57.729,be very subtle sometimes and hard to tell and B there are some clues that
8N0IZZpF8ts,2932,00:53:57.729,00:53:57.739,tell and B there are some clues that
8N0IZZpF8ts,2933,00:53:57.739,00:54:01.019,tell and B there are some clues that help number one look down the neck so
8N0IZZpF8ts,2934,00:54:01.019,00:54:01.029,help number one look down the neck so
8N0IZZpF8ts,2935,00:54:01.029,00:54:04.029,help number one look down the neck so look at this this is a hair follicle and
8N0IZZpF8ts,2936,00:54:04.029,00:54:04.039,look at this this is a hair follicle and
8N0IZZpF8ts,2937,00:54:04.039,00:54:05.859,look at this this is a hair follicle and what are all these gray atypical cells
8N0IZZpF8ts,2938,00:54:05.859,00:54:05.869,what are all these gray atypical cells
8N0IZZpF8ts,2939,00:54:05.869,00:54:07.269,what are all these gray atypical cells this is all melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,2940,00:54:07.269,00:54:07.279,this is all melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,2941,00:54:07.279,00:54:09.009,this is all melanoma these are melanoma and site two cells
8N0IZZpF8ts,2942,00:54:09.009,00:54:09.019,these are melanoma and site two cells
8N0IZZpF8ts,2943,00:54:09.019,00:54:11.170,these are melanoma and site two cells they're not nearly as pigmented as the

8N0IZZpF8ts,2945,00:54:11.180,00:54:13.660,they're not nearly as pigmented as the ones at the junction but they're growing
8N0IZZpF8ts,2946,00:54:13.660,00:54:13.670,ones at the junction but they're growing
8N0IZZpF8ts,2947,00:54:13.670,00:54:15.370,ones at the junction but they're growing all the way down replacing the basal

8N0IZZpF8ts,2957,00:54:23.630,00:54:25.660,all the way way down into this follicle look we're still still going down here
8N0IZZpF8ts,2958,00:54:25.660,00:54:25.670,look we're still still going down here
8N0IZZpF8ts,2959,00:54:25.670,00:54:28.120,look we're still still going down here all of that stuff all melanoma insights
8N0IZZpF8ts,2960,00:54:28.120,00:54:28.130,all of that stuff all melanoma insights
8N0IZZpF8ts,2961,00:54:28.130,00:54:30.580,all of that stuff all melanoma insights you all of this melanoma insights is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2962,00:54:30.580,00:54:30.590,you all of this melanoma insights is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2963,00:54:30.590,00:54:33.640,you all of this melanoma insights is spreading out into a sebaceous gland now
8N0IZZpF8ts,2964,00:54:33.640,00:54:33.650,spreading out into a sebaceous gland now
8N0IZZpF8ts,2965,00:54:33.650,00:54:34.930,spreading out into a sebaceous gland now sometimes you can see nests of

8N0IZZpF8ts,2967,00:54:34.940,00:54:36.610,sometimes you can see nests of melanocytes like in congenital knee by
8N0IZZpF8ts,2968,00:54:36.610,00:54:36.620,melanocytes like in congenital knee by
8N0IZZpF8ts,2969,00:54:36.620,00:54:39.430,melanocytes like in congenital knee by that are in the middle of a sebaceous
8N0IZZpF8ts,2970,00:54:39.430,00:54:39.440,that are in the middle of a sebaceous
8N0IZZpF8ts,2971,00:54:39.440,00:54:40.960,that are in the middle of a sebaceous gland or a hair follicle but when you

8N0IZZpF8ts,2973,00:54:40.970,00:54:42.610,gland or a hair follicle but when you see single-cell growth of a typical
8N0IZZpF8ts,2974,00:54:42.610,00:54:42.620,see single-cell growth of a typical
8N0IZZpF8ts,2975,00:54:42.620,00:54:45.010,see single-cell growth of a typical melanocytes down a hair follicle or down
8N0IZZpF8ts,2976,00:54:45.010,00:54:45.020,melanocytes down a hair follicle or down
8N0IZZpF8ts,2977,00:54:45.020,00:54:47.080,melanocytes down a hair follicle or down sweat ducts replacing the basal layer
8N0IZZpF8ts,2978,00:54:47.080,00:54:47.090,sweat ducts replacing the basal layer
8N0IZZpF8ts,2979,00:54:47.090,00:54:49.150,sweat ducts replacing the basal layer that's a worrisome site particularly if
8N0IZZpF8ts,2980,00:54:49.150,00:54:49.160,that's a worrisome site particularly if
8N0IZZpF8ts,2981,00:54:49.160,00:54:51.670,that's a worrisome site particularly if you're looking at a pigmented mole
8N0IZZpF8ts,2982,00:54:51.670,00:54:51.680,you're looking at a pigmented mole
8N0IZZpF8ts,2983,00:54:51.680,00:54:53.950,you're looking at a pigmented mole anesthetic lesion from elderly sun
8N0IZZpF8ts,2984,00:54:53.950,00:54:53.960,anesthetic lesion from elderly sun
8N0IZZpF8ts,2985,00:54:53.960,00:54:55.660,anesthetic lesion from elderly sun damaged skin and look you can see the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2986,00:54:55.660,00:54:55.670,damaged skin and look you can see the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2987,00:54:55.670,00:54:58.210,damaged skin and look you can see the same thing happening over here it's not
8N0IZZpF8ts,2988,00:54:58.210,00:54:58.220,same thing happening over here it's not
8N0IZZpF8ts,2989,00:54:58.220,00:55:00.010,same thing happening over here it's not nearly as dramatic but there are
8N0IZZpF8ts,2990,00:55:00.010,00:55:00.020,nearly as dramatic but there are
8N0IZZpF8ts,2991,00:55:00.020,00:55:02.230,nearly as dramatic but there are atypical melanocytes spreading down here
8N0IZZpF8ts,2992,00:55:02.230,00:55:02.240,atypical melanocytes spreading down here
8N0IZZpF8ts,2993,00:55:02.240,00:55:04.930,atypical melanocytes spreading down here and spreading over here and so this is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2994,00:55:04.930,00:55:04.940,and spreading over here and so this is
8N0IZZpF8ts,2995,00:55:04.940,00:55:07.600,and spreading over here and so this is extra evidence of confluent growth the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2996,00:55:07.600,00:55:07.610,extra evidence of confluent growth the
8N0IZZpF8ts,2997,00:55:07.610,00:55:09.670,extra evidence of confluent growth the lenta go malignant type of melanoma

8N0IZZpF8ts,3003,00:55:14.990,00:55:16.510,confluent growth much of the time it's often kind of skippy growth where you'll
8N0IZZpF8ts,3004,00:55:16.510,00:55:16.520,often kind of skippy growth where you'll
8N0IZZpF8ts,3005,00:55:16.520,00:55:18.580,often kind of skippy growth where you'll see nests and single cells and then
8N0IZZpF8ts,3006,00:55:18.580,00:55:18.590,see nests and single cells and then
8N0IZZpF8ts,3007,00:55:18.590,00:55:20.860,see nests and single cells and then spaces with very little melanocytes and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3008,00:55:20.860,00:55:20.870,spaces with very little melanocytes and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3009,00:55:20.870,00:55:22.750,spaces with very little melanocytes and then more melanocytes and it keeps kind
8N0IZZpF8ts,3010,00:55:22.750,00:55:22.760,then more melanocytes and it keeps kind
8N0IZZpF8ts,3011,00:55:22.760,00:55:25.120,then more melanocytes and it keeps kind of skipping all the way along and it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3012,00:55:25.120,00:55:25.130,of skipping all the way along and it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3013,00:55:25.130,00:55:26.830,of skipping all the way along and it's usually kind of broad and we'll go from
8N0IZZpF8ts,3014,00:55:26.830,00:55:26.840,usually kind of broad and we'll go from
8N0IZZpF8ts,3015,00:55:26.840,00:55:28.270,usually kind of broad and we'll go from one end of the biopsy to the other
8N0IZZpF8ts,3016,00:55:28.270,00:55:28.280,one end of the biopsy to the other
8N0IZZpF8ts,3017,00:55:28.280,00:55:31.390,one end of the biopsy to the other oftentimes let's look at this piece down
8N0IZZpF8ts,3018,00:55:31.390,00:55:31.400,oftentimes let's look at this piece down
8N0IZZpF8ts,3019,00:55:31.400,00:55:37.930,oftentimes let's look at this piece down here
8N0IZZpF8ts,3020,00:55:40.750,00:55:40.760,so here again is an example of a hair
8N0IZZpF8ts,3021,00:55:40.760,00:55:43.120,so here again is an example of a hair follicle and sebaceous gland with
8N0IZZpF8ts,3022,00:55:43.120,00:55:43.130,follicle and sebaceous gland with
8N0IZZpF8ts,3023,00:55:43.130,00:55:46.000,follicle and sebaceous gland with melanoma insight to tracking down into
8N0IZZpF8ts,3024,00:55:46.000,00:55:46.010,melanoma insight to tracking down into
8N0IZZpF8ts,3025,00:55:46.010,00:55:49.599,melanoma insight to tracking down into the NEX Aleppo thulium and here this is
8N0IZZpF8ts,3026,00:55:49.599,00:55:49.609,the NEX Aleppo thulium and here this is
8N0IZZpF8ts,3027,00:55:49.609,00:55:51.160,the NEX Aleppo thulium and here this is more obvious here at the junction we
8N0IZZpF8ts,3028,00:55:51.160,00:55:51.170,more obvious here at the junction we
8N0IZZpF8ts,3029,00:55:51.170,00:55:52.720,more obvious here at the junction we actually are starting to see nests and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3030,00:55:52.720,00:55:52.730,actually are starting to see nests and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3031,00:55:52.730,00:55:54.819,actually are starting to see nests and zones of confluent growth of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3032,00:55:54.819,00:55:54.829,zones of confluent growth of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3033,00:55:54.829,00:55:57.880,zones of confluent growth of the melanocytes and once you if you think
8N0IZZpF8ts,3034,00:55:57.880,00:55:57.890,melanocytes and once you if you think
8N0IZZpF8ts,3035,00:55:57.890,00:55:59.500,melanocytes and once you if you think you've got a solar lens to go but you
8N0IZZpF8ts,3036,00:55:59.500,00:55:59.510,you've got a solar lens to go but you
8N0IZZpF8ts,3037,00:55:59.510,00:56:01.539,you've got a solar lens to go but you start seeing nests actual nests of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3038,00:56:01.539,00:56:01.549,start seeing nests actual nests of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3039,00:56:01.549,00:56:03.130,start seeing nests actual nests of melanocytes is not a solar lens ago
8N0IZZpF8ts,3040,00:56:03.130,00:56:03.140,melanocytes is not a solar lens ago
8N0IZZpF8ts,3041,00:56:03.140,00:56:04.510,melanocytes is not a solar lens ago there may be a solar lens to go there
8N0IZZpF8ts,3042,00:56:04.510,00:56:04.520,there may be a solar lens to go there
8N0IZZpF8ts,3043,00:56:04.520,00:56:06.789,there may be a solar lens to go there also but you have to think once you have
8N0IZZpF8ts,3044,00:56:06.789,00:56:06.799,also but you have to think once you have
8N0IZZpF8ts,3045,00:56:06.799,00:56:08.380,also but you have to think once you have nest of melanocytes you have a mole
8N0IZZpF8ts,3046,00:56:08.380,00:56:08.390,nest of melanocytes you have a mole
8N0IZZpF8ts,3047,00:56:08.390,00:56:10.180,nest of melanocytes you have a mole anesthetic lesion either it's a nevis
8N0IZZpF8ts,3048,00:56:10.180,00:56:10.190,anesthetic lesion either it's a nevis
8N0IZZpF8ts,3049,00:56:10.190,00:56:11.680,anesthetic lesion either it's a nevis and maybe this person's had a little
8N0IZZpF8ts,3050,00:56:11.680,00:56:11.690,and maybe this person's had a little
8N0IZZpF8ts,3051,00:56:11.690,00:56:13.059,and maybe this person's had a little nevis their their whole life and now
8N0IZZpF8ts,3052,00:56:13.059,00:56:13.069,nevis their their whole life and now
8N0IZZpF8ts,3053,00:56:13.069,00:56:15.160,nevis their their whole life and now they're old and sun damage or it's a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3054,00:56:15.160,00:56:15.170,they're old and sun damage or it's a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3055,00:56:15.170,00:56:16.809,they're old and sun damage or it's a melanoma and so that's the kind of time
8N0IZZpF8ts,3056,00:56:16.809,00:56:16.819,melanoma and so that's the kind of time
8N0IZZpF8ts,3057,00:56:16.819,00:56:18.520,melanoma and so that's the kind of time we got to be really careful and i
8N0IZZpF8ts,3058,00:56:18.520,00:56:18.530,we got to be really careful and i
8N0IZZpF8ts,3059,00:56:18.530,00:56:20.170,we got to be really careful and i personally find that immuno stains can
8N0IZZpF8ts,3060,00:56:20.170,00:56:20.180,personally find that immuno stains can
8N0IZZpF8ts,3061,00:56:20.180,00:56:21.849,personally find that immuno stains can be helpful although you have to learn
8N0IZZpF8ts,3062,00:56:21.849,00:56:21.859,be helpful although you have to learn
8N0IZZpF8ts,3063,00:56:21.859,00:56:23.349,be helpful although you have to learn how to use them because sun damaged skin
8N0IZZpF8ts,3064,00:56:23.349,00:56:23.359,how to use them because sun damaged skin
8N0IZZpF8ts,3065,00:56:23.359,00:56:25.390,how to use them because sun damaged skin tends to have an increased number of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3066,00:56:25.390,00:56:25.400,tends to have an increased number of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3067,00:56:25.400,00:56:28.390,tends to have an increased number of kind of large melanocytes as a kind of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3068,00:56:28.390,00:56:28.400,kind of large melanocytes as a kind of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3069,00:56:28.400,00:56:30.400,kind of large melanocytes as a kind of Malayan acidic hyperplasia that gets
8N0IZZpF8ts,3070,00:56:30.400,00:56:30.410,Malayan acidic hyperplasia that gets
8N0IZZpF8ts,3071,00:56:30.410,00:56:32.650,Malayan acidic hyperplasia that gets induced by chronic UV exposure from the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3072,00:56:32.650,00:56:32.660,induced by chronic UV exposure from the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3073,00:56:32.660,00:56:36.160,induced by chronic UV exposure from the Sun and so you do have to be careful any
8N0IZZpF8ts,3074,00:56:36.160,00:56:36.170,Sun and so you do have to be careful any
8N0IZZpF8ts,3075,00:56:36.170,00:56:37.690,Sun and so you do have to be careful any old Sun damaged person is going to have
8N0IZZpF8ts,3076,00:56:37.690,00:56:37.700,old Sun damaged person is going to have
8N0IZZpF8ts,3077,00:56:37.700,00:56:39.609,old Sun damaged person is going to have more melanocytes and larger melanocytes
8N0IZZpF8ts,3078,00:56:39.609,00:56:39.619,more melanocytes and larger melanocytes
8N0IZZpF8ts,3079,00:56:39.619,00:56:43.029,more melanocytes and larger melanocytes than a younger non sun damaged person so
8N0IZZpF8ts,3080,00:56:43.029,00:56:43.039,than a younger non sun damaged person so
8N0IZZpF8ts,3081,00:56:43.039,00:56:45.370,than a younger non sun damaged person so you have to get used to how to interpret
8N0IZZpF8ts,3082,00:56:45.370,00:56:45.380,you have to get used to how to interpret
8N0IZZpF8ts,3083,00:56:45.380,00:56:48.099,you have to get used to how to interpret the immuno stains in that setting and if
8N0IZZpF8ts,3084,00:56:48.099,00:56:48.109,the immuno stains in that setting and if
8N0IZZpF8ts,3085,00:56:48.109,00:56:49.420,the immuno stains in that setting and if you're watching this in your say you're
8N0IZZpF8ts,3086,00:56:49.420,00:56:49.430,you're watching this in your say you're
8N0IZZpF8ts,3087,00:56:49.430,00:56:50.799,you're watching this in your say you're in private practice and don't see a lot
8N0IZZpF8ts,3088,00:56:50.799,00:56:50.809,in private practice and don't see a lot
8N0IZZpF8ts,3089,00:56:50.809,00:56:52.870,in private practice and don't see a lot of dirt path take some some skin from a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3090,00:56:52.870,00:56:52.880,of dirt path take some some skin from a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3091,00:56:52.880,00:56:54.670,of dirt path take some some skin from a basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,3092,00:56:54.670,00:56:54.680,basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,3093,00:56:54.680,00:56:55.990,basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma excision where you know there's not
8N0IZZpF8ts,3094,00:56:55.990,00:56:56.000,excision where you know there's not
8N0IZZpF8ts,3095,00:56:56.000,00:56:57.880,excision where you know there's not probably going to be any melanoma just
8N0IZZpF8ts,3096,00:56:57.880,00:56:57.890,probably going to be any melanoma just
8N0IZZpF8ts,3097,00:56:57.890,00:57:00.250,probably going to be any melanoma just background skin and do a sox10 stain on
8N0IZZpF8ts,3098,00:57:00.250,00:57:00.260,background skin and do a sox10 stain on
8N0IZZpF8ts,3099,00:57:00.260,00:57:02.680,background skin and do a sox10 stain on a few cases to get an idea of oh wow
8N0IZZpF8ts,3100,00:57:02.680,00:57:02.690,a few cases to get an idea of oh wow
8N0IZZpF8ts,3101,00:57:02.690,00:57:04.950,a few cases to get an idea of oh wow this is the density of melanocytes in
8N0IZZpF8ts,3102,00:57:04.950,00:57:04.960,this is the density of melanocytes in
8N0IZZpF8ts,3103,00:57:04.960,00:57:07.299,this is the density of melanocytes in that you see a lot of times an old Sun
8N0IZZpF8ts,3104,00:57:07.299,00:57:07.309,that you see a lot of times an old Sun
8N0IZZpF8ts,3105,00:57:07.309,00:57:08.920,that you see a lot of times an old Sun damaged skin so I think that's helpful
8N0IZZpF8ts,3106,00:57:08.920,00:57:08.930,damaged skin so I think that's helpful
8N0IZZpF8ts,3107,00:57:08.930,00:57:10.000,damaged skin so I think that's helpful and that can give you kind of a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3108,00:57:10.000,00:57:10.010,and that can give you kind of a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3109,00:57:10.010,00:57:12.099,and that can give you kind of a threshold or help you set your threshold
8N0IZZpF8ts,3110,00:57:12.099,00:57:12.109,threshold or help you set your threshold
8N0IZZpF8ts,3111,00:57:12.109,00:57:14.829,threshold or help you set your threshold for for what is an allowable amount of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3112,00:57:14.829,00:57:14.839,for for what is an allowable amount of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3113,00:57:14.839,00:57:16.870,for for what is an allowable amount of melanocytes versus what's worrisome I
8N0IZZpF8ts,3114,00:57:16.870,00:57:16.880,melanocytes versus what's worrisome I
8N0IZZpF8ts,3115,00:57:16.880,00:57:18.130,melanocytes versus what's worrisome I think the most important thing to me is
8N0IZZpF8ts,3116,00:57:18.130,00:57:18.140,think the most important thing to me is
8N0IZZpF8ts,3117,00:57:18.140,00:57:20.710,think the most important thing to me is if I do see zones of confluence if I see
8N0IZZpF8ts,3118,00:57:20.710,00:57:20.720,if I do see zones of confluence if I see
8N0IZZpF8ts,3119,00:57:20.720,00:57:23.500,if I do see zones of confluence if I see patchy skippy areas if I see nests and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3120,00:57:23.500,00:57:23.510,patchy skippy areas if I see nests and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3121,00:57:23.510,00:57:25.720,patchy skippy areas if I see nests and also if I see a tibia all those things
8N0IZZpF8ts,3122,00:57:25.720,00:57:25.730,also if I see a tibia all those things
8N0IZZpF8ts,3123,00:57:25.730,00:57:27.279,also if I see a tibia all those things can help me so this is a length ago
8N0IZZpF8ts,3124,00:57:27.279,00:57:27.289,can help me so this is a length ago
8N0IZZpF8ts,3125,00:57:27.289,00:57:29.079,can help me so this is a length ago malignant Sall melanoma in situ in this
8N0IZZpF8ts,3126,00:57:29.079,00:57:29.089,malignant Sall melanoma in situ in this
8N0IZZpF8ts,3127,00:57:29.089,00:57:31.180,malignant Sall melanoma in situ in this case is the lens to go malignant pattern
8N0IZZpF8ts,3128,00:57:31.180,00:57:31.190,case is the lens to go malignant pattern
8N0IZZpF8ts,3129,00:57:31.190,00:57:32.680,case is the lens to go malignant pattern and these often are kind of broad and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3130,00:57:32.680,00:57:32.690,and these often are kind of broad and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3131,00:57:32.690,00:57:34.900,and these often are kind of broad and spread widely and so it can be sometimes
8N0IZZpF8ts,3132,00:57:34.900,00:57:34.910,spread widely and so it can be sometimes
8N0IZZpF8ts,3133,00:57:34.910,00:57:39.210,spread widely and so it can be sometimes hard to get clear margins on them and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3134,00:57:39.210,00:57:39.220,hard to get clear margins on them and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3135,00:57:39.220,00:57:41.680,hard to get clear margins on them and here's an example it's not from the same
8N0IZZpF8ts,3136,00:57:41.680,00:57:41.690,here's an example it's not from the same
8N0IZZpF8ts,3137,00:57:41.690,00:57:45.069,here's an example it's not from the same case but here's a nice example actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,3138,00:57:45.069,00:57:45.079,case but here's a nice example actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,3139,00:57:45.079,00:57:47.859,case but here's a nice example actually of the staining that you can see in lens
8N0IZZpF8ts,3140,00:57:47.859,00:57:47.869,of the staining that you can see in lens
8N0IZZpF8ts,3141,00:57:47.869,00:57:49.720,of the staining that you can see in lens ago malignant okay this is actually a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3142,00:57:49.720,00:57:49.730,ago malignant okay this is actually a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3143,00:57:49.730,00:57:52.010,ago malignant okay this is actually a mark one stain it was a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3144,00:57:52.010,00:57:52.020,mark one stain it was a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3145,00:57:52.020,00:57:53.810,mark one stain it was a again it sustained I don't personally
8N0IZZpF8ts,3146,00:57:53.810,00:57:53.820,again it sustained I don't personally
8N0IZZpF8ts,3147,00:57:53.820,00:57:55.400,again it sustained I don't personally like to use very often looking for
8N0IZZpF8ts,3148,00:57:55.400,00:57:55.410,like to use very often looking for
8N0IZZpF8ts,3149,00:57:55.410,00:57:57.890,like to use very often looking for melanoma inside too it's useful I think
8N0IZZpF8ts,3150,00:57:57.890,00:57:57.900,melanoma inside too it's useful I think
8N0IZZpF8ts,3151,00:57:57.900,00:57:59.600,melanoma inside too it's useful I think in if you're looking at lymph nodes or
8N0IZZpF8ts,3152,00:57:59.600,00:57:59.610,in if you're looking at lymph nodes or
8N0IZZpF8ts,3153,00:57:59.610,00:58:02.450,in if you're looking at lymph nodes or metastatic lesions sometimes or if
8N0IZZpF8ts,3154,00:58:02.450,00:58:02.460,metastatic lesions sometimes or if
8N0IZZpF8ts,3155,00:58:02.460,00:58:03.830,metastatic lesions sometimes or if you're looking for invasion it can be
8N0IZZpF8ts,3156,00:58:03.830,00:58:03.840,you're looking for invasion it can be
8N0IZZpF8ts,3157,00:58:03.840,00:58:06.020,you're looking for invasion it can be helpful for insight too I prefer sox10
8N0IZZpF8ts,3158,00:58:06.020,00:58:06.030,helpful for insight too I prefer sox10
8N0IZZpF8ts,3159,00:58:06.030,00:58:10.210,helpful for insight too I prefer sox10 personally but it's still a good example
8N0IZZpF8ts,3160,00:58:10.210,00:58:10.220,personally but it's still a good example
8N0IZZpF8ts,3161,00:58:10.220,00:58:14.840,personally but it's still a good example there's Paget widespread there and look
8N0IZZpF8ts,3162,00:58:14.840,00:58:14.850,there's Paget widespread there and look
8N0IZZpF8ts,3163,00:58:14.850,00:58:16.100,there's Paget widespread there and look out here at the periphery this is the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3164,00:58:16.100,00:58:16.110,out here at the periphery this is the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3165,00:58:16.110,00:58:17.090,out here at the periphery this is the reason that I think you got to be a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3166,00:58:17.090,00:58:17.100,reason that I think you got to be a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3167,00:58:17.100,00:58:19.040,reason that I think you got to be a little careful when you use mark 1 look
8N0IZZpF8ts,3168,00:58:19.040,00:58:19.050,little careful when you use mark 1 look
8N0IZZpF8ts,3169,00:58:19.050,00:58:21.620,little careful when you use mark 1 look what we have here you can see there's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3170,00:58:21.620,00:58:21.630,what we have here you can see there's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3171,00:58:21.630,00:58:23.420,what we have here you can see there's strong staining of a cytoplasm but look
8N0IZZpF8ts,3172,00:58:23.420,00:58:23.430,strong staining of a cytoplasm but look
8N0IZZpF8ts,3173,00:58:23.430,00:58:24.920,strong staining of a cytoplasm but look also the melanocytes have little
8N0IZZpF8ts,3174,00:58:24.920,00:58:24.930,also the melanocytes have little
8N0IZZpF8ts,3175,00:58:24.930,00:58:26.630,also the melanocytes have little branching dendritic processes that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3176,00:58:26.630,00:58:26.640,branching dendritic processes that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3177,00:58:26.640,00:58:29.390,branching dendritic processes that's what they normally use to feed melanin
8N0IZZpF8ts,3178,00:58:29.390,00:58:29.400,what they normally use to feed melanin
8N0IZZpF8ts,3179,00:58:29.400,00:58:31.100,what they normally use to feed melanin that they produce into their neighboring
8N0IZZpF8ts,3180,00:58:31.100,00:58:31.110,that they produce into their neighboring
8N0IZZpF8ts,3181,00:58:31.110,00:58:33.080,that they produce into their neighboring keratinocytes but what happens here is
8N0IZZpF8ts,3182,00:58:33.080,00:58:33.090,keratinocytes but what happens here is
8N0IZZpF8ts,3183,00:58:33.090,00:58:35.240,keratinocytes but what happens here is it makes each single melanocytes a lot
8N0IZZpF8ts,3184,00:58:35.240,00:58:35.250,it makes each single melanocytes a lot
8N0IZZpF8ts,3185,00:58:35.250,00:58:37.400,it makes each single melanocytes a lot bigger and kind of broader than it is
8N0IZZpF8ts,3186,00:58:37.400,00:58:37.410,bigger and kind of broader than it is
8N0IZZpF8ts,3187,00:58:37.410,00:58:39.320,bigger and kind of broader than it is actually because it of its cytoplasmic
8N0IZZpF8ts,3188,00:58:39.320,00:58:39.330,actually because it of its cytoplasmic
8N0IZZpF8ts,3189,00:58:39.330,00:58:42.290,actually because it of its cytoplasmic processes so it can the mark one stain
8N0IZZpF8ts,3190,00:58:42.290,00:58:42.300,processes so it can the mark one stain
8N0IZZpF8ts,3191,00:58:42.300,00:58:43.550,processes so it can the mark one stain can make it look like there are more
8N0IZZpF8ts,3192,00:58:43.550,00:58:43.560,can make it look like there are more
8N0IZZpF8ts,3193,00:58:43.560,00:58:45.440,can make it look like there are more melanocytes there than there actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,3194,00:58:45.440,00:58:45.450,melanocytes there than there actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,3195,00:58:45.450,00:58:48.740,melanocytes there than there actually are in the sox10 or MIT F nuclear stains
8N0IZZpF8ts,3196,00:58:48.740,00:58:48.750,are in the sox10 or MIT F nuclear stains
8N0IZZpF8ts,3197,00:58:48.750,00:58:50.450,are in the sox10 or MIT F nuclear stains we'll just show you the nucleus of each
8N0IZZpF8ts,3198,00:58:50.450,00:58:50.460,we'll just show you the nucleus of each
8N0IZZpF8ts,3199,00:58:50.460,00:58:53.270,we'll just show you the nucleus of each cell and I think it's a little easier to
8N0IZZpF8ts,3200,00:58:53.270,00:58:53.280,cell and I think it's a little easier to
8N0IZZpF8ts,3201,00:58:53.280,00:58:54.710,cell and I think it's a little easier to kind of quantify how many cells are
8N0IZZpF8ts,3202,00:58:54.710,00:58:54.720,kind of quantify how many cells are
8N0IZZpF8ts,3203,00:58:54.720,00:58:56.810,kind of quantify how many cells are really there but sometimes it still
8N0IZZpF8ts,3204,00:58:56.810,00:58:56.820,really there but sometimes it still
8N0IZZpF8ts,3205,00:58:56.820,00:59:02.260,really there but sometimes it still works because you have areas like this
8N0IZZpF8ts,3206,00:59:02.260,00:59:02.270,works because you have areas like this
8N0IZZpF8ts,3207,00:59:02.270,00:59:05.810,works because you have areas like this where there's obviously prominent Paget
8N0IZZpF8ts,3208,00:59:05.810,00:59:05.820,where there's obviously prominent Paget
8N0IZZpF8ts,3209,00:59:05.820,00:59:07.430,where there's obviously prominent Paget which spread and the basal layer is
8N0IZZpF8ts,3210,00:59:07.430,00:59:07.440,which spread and the basal layer is
8N0IZZpF8ts,3211,00:59:07.440,00:59:09.860,which spread and the basal layer is basically completely replaced by a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3212,00:59:09.860,00:59:09.870,basically completely replaced by a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3213,00:59:09.870,00:59:14.050,basically completely replaced by a typical melanocytes so this is melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,3214,00:59:14.050,00:59:14.060,typical melanocytes so this is melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,3215,00:59:14.060,00:59:17.330,typical melanocytes so this is melanoma and lens ago malignant sometimes will
8N0IZZpF8ts,3216,00:59:17.330,00:59:17.340,and lens ago malignant sometimes will
8N0IZZpF8ts,3217,00:59:17.340,00:59:18.950,and lens ago malignant sometimes will have Paget Toit spread oftentimes it
8N0IZZpF8ts,3218,00:59:18.950,00:59:18.960,have Paget Toit spread oftentimes it
8N0IZZpF8ts,3219,00:59:18.960,00:59:20.720,have Paget Toit spread oftentimes it doesn't though or has very little so
8N0IZZpF8ts,3220,00:59:20.720,00:59:20.730,doesn't though or has very little so
8N0IZZpF8ts,3221,00:59:20.730,00:59:22.430,doesn't though or has very little so don't expect to always see Paget
8N0IZZpF8ts,3222,00:59:22.430,00:59:22.440,don't expect to always see Paget
8N0IZZpF8ts,3223,00:59:22.440,00:59:23.990,don't expect to always see Paget widespread for a limb to go malignant
8N0IZZpF8ts,3224,00:59:23.990,00:59:24.000,widespread for a limb to go malignant
8N0IZZpF8ts,3225,00:59:24.000,00:59:25.580,widespread for a limb to go malignant and then here's an area where there is
8N0IZZpF8ts,3226,00:59:25.580,00:59:25.590,and then here's an area where there is
8N0IZZpF8ts,3227,00:59:25.590,00:59:27.200,and then here's an area where there is actually a couple little tiny nests of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3228,00:59:27.200,00:59:27.210,actually a couple little tiny nests of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3229,00:59:27.210,00:59:29.690,actually a couple little tiny nests of dermal invasion and so the Mart one help
8N0IZZpF8ts,3230,00:59:29.690,00:59:29.700,dermal invasion and so the Mart one help
8N0IZZpF8ts,3231,00:59:29.700,00:59:31.280,dermal invasion and so the Mart one help can help pick that up if you're if
8N0IZZpF8ts,3232,00:59:31.280,00:59:31.290,can help pick that up if you're if
8N0IZZpF8ts,3233,00:59:31.290,00:59:32.660,can help pick that up if you're if you've got a lot of inflammation or
8N0IZZpF8ts,3234,00:59:32.660,00:59:32.670,you've got a lot of inflammation or
8N0IZZpF8ts,3235,00:59:32.670,00:59:35.180,you've got a lot of inflammation or background regression changes or at one
8N0IZZpF8ts,3236,00:59:35.180,00:59:35.190,background regression changes or at one
8N0IZZpF8ts,3237,00:59:35.190,00:59:36.680,background regression changes or at one can sometimes be helpful to show you a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3238,00:59:36.680,00:59:36.690,can sometimes be helpful to show you a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3239,00:59:36.690,00:59:38.600,can sometimes be helpful to show you a subtle focal invasion that's kind of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3240,00:59:38.600,00:59:38.610,subtle focal invasion that's kind of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3241,00:59:38.610,00:59:40.520,subtle focal invasion that's kind of hiding in the background so that's an
8N0IZZpF8ts,3242,00:59:40.520,00:59:40.530,hiding in the background so that's an
8N0IZZpF8ts,3243,00:59:40.530,00:59:42.680,hiding in the background so that's an example of what immunostaining again
8N0IZZpF8ts,3244,00:59:42.680,00:59:42.690,example of what immunostaining again
8N0IZZpF8ts,3245,00:59:42.690,00:59:44.090,example of what immunostaining again I'll make a video in the future I think
8N0IZZpF8ts,3246,00:59:44.090,00:59:44.100,I'll make a video in the future I think
8N0IZZpF8ts,3247,00:59:44.100,00:59:45.680,I'll make a video in the future I think showing immuno stands firmly on
8N0IZZpF8ts,3248,00:59:45.680,00:59:45.690,showing immuno stands firmly on
8N0IZZpF8ts,3249,00:59:45.690,00:59:50.890,showing immuno stands firmly on aesthetic lesions in more more detail
8N0IZZpF8ts,3250,00:59:53.150,00:59:53.160,now what I want to show for this lesion
8N0IZZpF8ts,3251,00:59:53.160,00:59:59.950,now what I want to show for this lesion here here's a melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,3252,01:00:02.330,01:00:02.340,again we've got focal areas like this
8N0IZZpF8ts,3253,01:00:02.340,01:00:04.760,again we've got focal areas like this I've confluent growth areas where
8N0IZZpF8ts,3254,01:00:04.760,01:00:04.770,I've confluent growth areas where
8N0IZZpF8ts,3255,01:00:04.770,01:00:06.530,I've confluent growth areas where there's melanocytes replacing much of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3256,01:00:06.530,01:00:06.540,there's melanocytes replacing much of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3257,01:00:06.540,01:00:08.900,there's melanocytes replacing much of the basal layer and spreading in between
8N0IZZpF8ts,3258,01:00:08.900,01:00:08.910,the basal layer and spreading in between
8N0IZZpF8ts,3259,01:00:08.910,01:00:11.900,the basal layer and spreading in between reading but why I wash to this case is
8N0IZZpF8ts,3260,01:00:11.900,01:00:11.910,reading but why I wash to this case is
8N0IZZpF8ts,3261,01:00:11.910,01:00:14.330,reading but why I wash to this case is because this is an example of regression
8N0IZZpF8ts,3262,01:00:14.330,01:00:14.340,because this is an example of regression
8N0IZZpF8ts,3263,01:00:14.340,01:00:17.030,because this is an example of regression change okay regression is this kind of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3264,01:00:17.030,01:00:17.040,change okay regression is this kind of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3265,01:00:17.040,01:00:19.130,change okay regression is this kind of response that happens in the dermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,3266,01:00:19.130,01:00:19.140,response that happens in the dermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,3267,01:00:19.140,01:00:21.590,response that happens in the dermis under a melanoma and it the theory is
8N0IZZpF8ts,3268,01:00:21.590,01:00:21.600,under a melanoma and it the theory is
8N0IZZpF8ts,3269,01:00:21.600,01:00:23.510,under a melanoma and it the theory is that the melanoma invaded into that area
8N0IZZpF8ts,3270,01:00:23.510,01:00:23.520,that the melanoma invaded into that area
8N0IZZpF8ts,3271,01:00:23.520,01:00:24.940,that the melanoma invaded into that area of the dermis and then the immune system
8N0IZZpF8ts,3272,01:00:24.940,01:00:24.950,of the dermis and then the immune system
8N0IZZpF8ts,3273,01:00:24.950,01:00:27.350,of the dermis and then the immune system destroyed part of the melanoma and then
8N0IZZpF8ts,3274,01:00:27.350,01:00:27.360,destroyed part of the melanoma and then
8N0IZZpF8ts,3275,01:00:27.360,01:00:29.690,destroyed part of the melanoma and then kind of scar tissue inflammation filled
8N0IZZpF8ts,3276,01:00:29.690,01:00:29.700,kind of scar tissue inflammation filled
8N0IZZpF8ts,3277,01:00:29.700,01:00:32.750,kind of scar tissue inflammation filled in that space now in reality just
8N0IZZpF8ts,3278,01:00:32.750,01:00:32.760,in that space now in reality just
8N0IZZpF8ts,3279,01:00:32.760,01:00:34.130,in that space now in reality just because an area looks like regression
8N0IZZpF8ts,3280,01:00:34.130,01:00:34.140,because an area looks like regression
8N0IZZpF8ts,3281,01:00:34.140,01:00:35.930,because an area looks like regression doesn't necessarily mean there was there
8N0IZZpF8ts,3282,01:00:35.930,01:00:35.940,doesn't necessarily mean there was there
8N0IZZpF8ts,3283,01:00:35.940,01:00:37.370,doesn't necessarily mean there was there used to be invasive melanoma there
8N0IZZpF8ts,3284,01:00:37.370,01:00:37.380,used to be invasive melanoma there
8N0IZZpF8ts,3285,01:00:37.380,01:00:39.230,used to be invasive melanoma there sometimes we see regression like changes
8N0IZZpF8ts,3286,01:00:39.230,01:00:39.240,sometimes we see regression like changes
8N0IZZpF8ts,3287,01:00:39.240,01:00:41.660,sometimes we see regression like changes under melanoma in situ in fact I see
8N0IZZpF8ts,3288,01:00:41.660,01:00:41.670,under melanoma in situ in fact I see
8N0IZZpF8ts,3289,01:00:41.670,01:00:43.760,under melanoma in situ in fact I see that relatively often and I'm not
8N0IZZpF8ts,3290,01:00:43.760,01:00:43.770,that relatively often and I'm not
8N0IZZpF8ts,3291,01:00:43.770,01:00:45.260,that relatively often and I'm not totally sure that every single one of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3292,01:00:45.260,01:00:45.270,totally sure that every single one of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3293,01:00:45.270,01:00:47.390,totally sure that every single one of those cases definitely had invasion
8N0IZZpF8ts,3294,01:00:47.390,01:00:47.400,those cases definitely had invasion
8N0IZZpF8ts,3295,01:00:47.400,01:00:49.370,those cases definitely had invasion that's now regressed it may just be kind
8N0IZZpF8ts,3296,01:00:49.370,01:00:49.380,that's now regressed it may just be kind
8N0IZZpF8ts,3297,01:00:49.380,01:00:51.560,that's now regressed it may just be kind of a robust form of host immune system
8N0IZZpF8ts,3298,01:00:51.560,01:00:51.570,of a robust form of host immune system
8N0IZZpF8ts,3299,01:00:51.570,01:00:54.200,of a robust form of host immune system host response against the tumor that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3300,01:00:54.200,01:00:54.210,host response against the tumor that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3301,01:00:54.210,01:00:55.760,host response against the tumor that's happened but the point is when I see
8N0IZZpF8ts,3302,01:00:55.760,01:00:55.770,happened but the point is when I see
8N0IZZpF8ts,3303,01:00:55.770,01:00:57.470,happened but the point is when I see this and see a significant amount of it
8N0IZZpF8ts,3304,01:00:57.470,01:00:57.480,this and see a significant amount of it
8N0IZZpF8ts,3305,01:00:57.480,01:01:00.560,this and see a significant amount of it I like to report it and it's one of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3306,01:01:00.560,01:01:00.570,I like to report it and it's one of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3307,01:01:00.570,01:01:02.180,I like to report it and it's one of the things that in the prognostic parameters
8N0IZZpF8ts,3308,01:01:02.180,01:01:02.190,things that in the prognostic parameters
8N0IZZpF8ts,3309,01:01:02.190,01:01:03.620,things that in the prognostic parameters that we often report for melanomas
8N0IZZpF8ts,3310,01:01:03.620,01:01:03.630,that we often report for melanomas
8N0IZZpF8ts,3311,01:01:03.630,01:01:05.180,that we often report for melanomas although the significance is somewhat
8N0IZZpF8ts,3312,01:01:05.180,01:01:05.190,although the significance is somewhat
8N0IZZpF8ts,3313,01:01:05.190,01:01:06.830,although the significance is somewhat debatable people have argued that it's a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3314,01:01:06.830,01:01:06.840,debatable people have argued that it's a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3315,01:01:06.840,01:01:08.240,debatable people have argued that it's a bad thing or that maybe it's a good
8N0IZZpF8ts,3316,01:01:08.240,01:01:08.250,bad thing or that maybe it's a good
8N0IZZpF8ts,3317,01:01:08.250,01:01:10.190,bad thing or that maybe it's a good thing and there have been people that
8N0IZZpF8ts,3318,01:01:10.190,01:01:10.200,thing and there have been people that
8N0IZZpF8ts,3319,01:01:10.200,01:01:12.140,thing and there have been people that have argued back and forth so if I see
8N0IZZpF8ts,3320,01:01:12.140,01:01:12.150,have argued back and forth so if I see
8N0IZZpF8ts,3321,01:01:12.150,01:01:13.970,have argued back and forth so if I see it I usually will mention it in my
8N0IZZpF8ts,3322,01:01:13.970,01:01:13.980,it I usually will mention it in my
8N0IZZpF8ts,3323,01:01:13.980,01:01:15.980,it I usually will mention it in my report but I think and I think it's an
8N0IZZpF8ts,3324,01:01:15.980,01:01:15.990,report but I think and I think it's an
8N0IZZpF8ts,3325,01:01:15.990,01:01:18.020,report but I think and I think it's an important feature to recognize in
8N0IZZpF8ts,3326,01:01:18.020,01:01:18.030,important feature to recognize in
8N0IZZpF8ts,3327,01:01:18.030,01:01:20.990,important feature to recognize in melanomas what we usually see in
8N0IZZpF8ts,3328,01:01:20.990,01:01:21.000,melanomas what we usually see in
8N0IZZpF8ts,3329,01:01:21.000,01:01:22.340,melanomas what we usually see in regression are three things we see
8N0IZZpF8ts,3330,01:01:22.340,01:01:22.350,regression are three things we see
8N0IZZpF8ts,3331,01:01:22.350,01:01:24.920,regression are three things we see disorganized collagen bundles collagen
8N0IZZpF8ts,3332,01:01:24.920,01:01:24.930,disorganized collagen bundles collagen
8N0IZZpF8ts,3333,01:01:24.930,01:01:27.590,disorganized collagen bundles collagen fibers we see lymphocytic we see
8N0IZZpF8ts,3334,01:01:27.590,01:01:27.600,fibers we see lymphocytic we see
8N0IZZpF8ts,3335,01:01:27.600,01:01:29.030,fibers we see lymphocytic we see inflammation usually lymphocytes and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3336,01:01:29.030,01:01:29.040,inflammation usually lymphocytes and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3337,01:01:29.040,01:01:31.130,inflammation usually lymphocytes and sometimes histiocytes and we often see
8N0IZZpF8ts,3338,01:01:31.130,01:01:31.140,sometimes histiocytes and we often see
8N0IZZpF8ts,3339,01:01:31.140,01:01:33.200,sometimes histiocytes and we often see pigment drop out or pigment incontinence
8N0IZZpF8ts,3340,01:01:33.200,01:01:33.210,pigment drop out or pigment incontinence
8N0IZZpF8ts,3341,01:01:33.210,01:01:34.970,pigment drop out or pigment incontinence emollient of phages so here this
8N0IZZpF8ts,3342,01:01:34.970,01:01:34.980,emollient of phages so here this
8N0IZZpF8ts,3343,01:01:34.980,01:01:37.370,emollient of phages so here this disorganized pattern of collagen fibers
8N0IZZpF8ts,3344,01:01:37.370,01:01:37.380,disorganized pattern of collagen fibers
8N0IZZpF8ts,3345,01:01:37.380,01:01:39.970,disorganized pattern of collagen fibers with intermingled lymphocytes and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3346,01:01:39.970,01:01:39.980,with intermingled lymphocytes and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3347,01:01:39.980,01:01:45.320,with intermingled lymphocytes and occasional melania phages - this is a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3348,01:01:45.320,01:01:45.330,occasional melania phages - this is a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3349,01:01:45.330,01:01:47.930,occasional melania phages - this is a good example of I think regression
8N0IZZpF8ts,3350,01:01:47.930,01:01:47.940,good example of I think regression
8N0IZZpF8ts,3351,01:01:47.940,01:01:49.190,good example of I think regression change and sometimes there can be
8N0IZZpF8ts,3352,01:01:49.190,01:01:49.200,change and sometimes there can be
8N0IZZpF8ts,3353,01:01:49.200,01:01:52.040,change and sometimes there can be bunches of pigment in it sometimes it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3354,01:01:52.040,01:01:52.050,bunches of pigment in it sometimes it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3355,01:01:52.050,01:01:53.660,bunches of pigment in it sometimes it's very fibrotic sometimes it's very
8N0IZZpF8ts,3356,01:01:53.660,01:01:53.670,very fibrotic sometimes it's very
8N0IZZpF8ts,3357,01:01:53.670,01:01:55.460,very fibrotic sometimes it's very inflamed it just kind of depends on the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3358,01:01:55.460,01:01:55.470,inflamed it just kind of depends on the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3359,01:01:55.470,01:01:57.230,inflamed it just kind of depends on the individual lesion of what stage it's at
8N0IZZpF8ts,3360,01:01:57.230,01:01:57.240,individual lesion of what stage it's at
8N0IZZpF8ts,3361,01:01:57.240,01:01:59.359,individual lesion of what stage it's at but look at low power to give you an
8N0IZZpF8ts,3362,01:01:59.359,01:01:59.369,but look at low power to give you an
8N0IZZpF8ts,3363,01:01:59.369,01:02:06.290,but look at low power to give you an example this is what the kind of normal
8N0IZZpF8ts,3364,01:02:06.290,01:02:06.300,example this is what the kind of normal
8N0IZZpF8ts,3365,01:02:06.300,01:02:08.300,example this is what the kind of normal thermos looks like in this person you
8N0IZZpF8ts,3366,01:02:08.300,01:02:08.310,thermos looks like in this person you
8N0IZZpF8ts,3367,01:02:08.310,01:02:10.440,thermos looks like in this person you get the epidermis up top
8N0IZZpF8ts,3368,01:02:10.440,01:02:10.450,get the epidermis up top
8N0IZZpF8ts,3369,01:02:10.450,01:02:12.870,get the epidermis up top the papillary dermis is normally filled
8N0IZZpF8ts,3370,01:02:12.870,01:02:12.880,the papillary dermis is normally filled
8N0IZZpF8ts,3371,01:02:12.880,01:02:16.069,the papillary dermis is normally filled with fine delicate collagen fibers and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3372,01:02:16.069,01:02:16.079,with fine delicate collagen fibers and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3373,01:02:16.079,01:02:18.630,with fine delicate collagen fibers and then the reticular dermis has big thick
8N0IZZpF8ts,3374,01:02:18.630,01:02:18.640,then the reticular dermis has big thick
8N0IZZpF8ts,3375,01:02:18.640,01:02:22.819,then the reticular dermis has big thick bundles of collagen type 1 okay so
8N0IZZpF8ts,3376,01:02:22.819,01:02:22.829,bundles of collagen type 1 okay so
8N0IZZpF8ts,3377,01:02:22.829,01:02:24.930,bundles of collagen type 1 okay so that's kind of the normal dermis and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3378,01:02:24.930,01:02:24.940,that's kind of the normal dermis and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3379,01:02:24.940,01:02:28.140,that's kind of the normal dermis and then look over here see that zone of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3380,01:02:28.140,01:02:28.150,then look over here see that zone of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3381,01:02:28.150,01:02:30.299,then look over here see that zone of the papillary dermis has been totally

8N0IZZpF8ts,3385,01:02:33.040,01:02:34.770,replaced by this disorganized fibrosis with thicker collagen bundles but not
8N0IZZpF8ts,3386,01:02:34.770,01:02:34.780,with thicker collagen bundles but not
8N0IZZpF8ts,3387,01:02:34.780,01:02:36.780,with thicker collagen bundles but not quite as thick as the reticular dermal
8N0IZZpF8ts,3388,01:02:36.780,01:02:36.790,quite as thick as the reticular dermal
8N0IZZpF8ts,3389,01:02:36.790,01:02:38.640,quite as thick as the reticular dermal collagen and they're very disorganized
8N0IZZpF8ts,3390,01:02:38.640,01:02:38.650,collagen and they're very disorganized
8N0IZZpF8ts,3391,01:02:38.650,01:02:40.170,collagen and they're very disorganized and they're intermingled with
8N0IZZpF8ts,3392,01:02:40.170,01:02:40.180,and they're intermingled with
8N0IZZpF8ts,3393,01:02:40.180,01:02:41.970,and they're intermingled with inflammation and they're not usually
8N0IZZpF8ts,3394,01:02:41.970,01:02:41.980,inflammation and they're not usually
8N0IZZpF8ts,3395,01:02:41.980,01:02:43.859,inflammation and they're not usually quite as organized as scar sometimes it
8N0IZZpF8ts,3396,01:02:43.859,01:02:43.869,quite as organized as scar sometimes it
8N0IZZpF8ts,3397,01:02:43.869,01:02:45.420,quite as organized as scar sometimes it can be hard to tell apart scar from a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3398,01:02:45.420,01:02:45.430,can be hard to tell apart scar from a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3399,01:02:45.430,01:02:48.059,can be hard to tell apart scar from a previous biopsy versus regression change
8N0IZZpF8ts,3400,01:02:48.059,01:02:48.069,previous biopsy versus regression change
8N0IZZpF8ts,3401,01:02:48.069,01:02:50.549,previous biopsy versus regression change okay but it's a good thing to be
8N0IZZpF8ts,3402,01:02:50.549,01:02:50.559,okay but it's a good thing to be
8N0IZZpF8ts,3403,01:02:50.559,01:02:52.170,okay but it's a good thing to be familiar with and know what regression
8N0IZZpF8ts,3404,01:02:52.170,01:02:52.180,familiar with and know what regression
8N0IZZpF8ts,3405,01:02:52.180,01:02:54.569,familiar with and know what regression looks like and also regressions a little
8N0IZZpF8ts,3406,01:02:54.569,01:02:54.579,looks like and also regressions a little
8N0IZZpF8ts,3407,01:02:54.579,01:02:55.770,looks like and also regressions a little bit in the eye of the beholder too
8N0IZZpF8ts,3408,01:02:55.770,01:02:55.780,bit in the eye of the beholder too
8N0IZZpF8ts,3409,01:02:55.780,01:02:56.730,bit in the eye of the beholder too sometimes I'll think something looks
8N0IZZpF8ts,3410,01:02:56.730,01:02:56.740,sometimes I'll think something looks
8N0IZZpF8ts,3411,01:02:56.740,01:02:58.650,sometimes I'll think something looks like regression and a colleague might
8N0IZZpF8ts,3412,01:02:58.650,01:02:58.660,like regression and a colleague might
8N0IZZpF8ts,3413,01:02:58.660,01:02:59.819,like regression and a colleague might say well I don't really think that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3414,01:02:59.819,01:02:59.829,say well I don't really think that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3415,01:02:59.829,01:03:01.890,say well I don't really think that's necessarily regression it just kind of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3416,01:03:01.890,01:03:01.900,necessarily regression it just kind of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3417,01:03:01.900,01:03:03.839,necessarily regression it just kind of depends on the your your personal
8N0IZZpF8ts,3418,01:03:03.839,01:03:03.849,depends on the your your personal
8N0IZZpF8ts,3419,01:03:03.849,01:03:08.190,depends on the your your personal threshold all right in the last main
8N0IZZpF8ts,3420,01:03:08.190,01:03:08.200,threshold all right in the last main
8N0IZZpF8ts,3421,01:03:08.200,01:03:09.240,threshold all right in the last main type of melanoma we're going to talk
8N0IZZpF8ts,3422,01:03:09.240,01:03:09.250,type of melanoma we're going to talk
8N0IZZpF8ts,3423,01:03:09.250,01:03:10.829,type of melanoma we're going to talk about today is this one that I can't
8N0IZZpF8ts,3424,01:03:10.829,01:03:10.839,about today is this one that I can't
8N0IZZpF8ts,3425,01:03:10.839,01:03:12.750,about today is this one that I can't even get on the screens it's so big this
8N0IZZpF8ts,3426,01:03:12.750,01:03:12.760,even get on the screens it's so big this
8N0IZZpF8ts,3427,01:03:12.760,01:03:14.880,even get on the screens it's so big this is a nodular melanoma right it's a big
8N0IZZpF8ts,3428,01:03:14.880,01:03:14.890,is a nodular melanoma right it's a big
8N0IZZpF8ts,3429,01:03:14.890,01:03:20.450,is a nodular melanoma right it's a big nodule huge nodule of tumor of melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,3430,01:03:20.450,01:03:20.460,nodule huge nodule of tumor of melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,3431,01:03:20.460,01:03:23.039,nodule huge nodule of tumor of melanoma it's got a big ulcer at the top and so
8N0IZZpF8ts,3432,01:03:23.039,01:03:23.049,it's got a big ulcer at the top and so
8N0IZZpF8ts,3433,01:03:23.049,01:03:25.770,it's got a big ulcer at the top and so ulceration is a bad prognostic feature
8N0IZZpF8ts,3434,01:03:25.770,01:03:25.780,ulceration is a bad prognostic feature
8N0IZZpF8ts,3435,01:03:25.780,01:03:28.319,ulceration is a bad prognostic feature for melanomas usually melanomas that are
8N0IZZpF8ts,3436,01:03:28.319,01:03:28.329,for melanomas usually melanomas that are
8N0IZZpF8ts,3437,01:03:28.329,01:03:30.630,for melanomas usually melanomas that are all serrated are all so thick and have a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3438,01:03:30.630,01:03:30.640,all serrated are all so thick and have a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3439,01:03:30.640,01:03:32.819,all serrated are all so thick and have a lot of mitosis so they usually have a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3440,01:03:32.819,01:03:32.829,lot of mitosis so they usually have a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3441,01:03:32.829,01:03:35.579,lot of mitosis so they usually have a high Breslow thickness and have mitotic
8N0IZZpF8ts,3442,01:03:35.579,01:03:35.589,high Breslow thickness and have mitotic
8N0IZZpF8ts,3443,01:03:35.589,01:03:36.660,high Breslow thickness and have mitotic activity so they have other features
8N0IZZpF8ts,3444,01:03:36.660,01:03:36.670,activity so they have other features
8N0IZZpF8ts,3445,01:03:36.670,01:03:40.020,activity so they have other features that would be bad also but that's I
8N0IZZpF8ts,3446,01:03:40.020,01:03:40.030,that would be bad also but that's I
8N0IZZpF8ts,3447,01:03:40.030,01:03:41.970,that would be bad also but that's I think part of why ulceration is a bad
8N0IZZpF8ts,3448,01:03:41.970,01:03:41.980,think part of why ulceration is a bad
8N0IZZpF8ts,3449,01:03:41.980,01:03:43.440,think part of why ulceration is a bad sign is that it indicates the tumor is
8N0IZZpF8ts,3450,01:03:43.440,01:03:43.450,sign is that it indicates the tumor is
8N0IZZpF8ts,3451,01:03:43.450,01:03:45.720,sign is that it indicates the tumor is growing really rapidly and those are
8N0IZZpF8ts,3452,01:03:45.720,01:03:45.730,growing really rapidly and those are
8N0IZZpF8ts,3453,01:03:45.730,01:03:47.670,growing really rapidly and those are tend to be tumors that end up end up
8N0IZZpF8ts,3454,01:03:47.670,01:03:47.680,tend to be tumors that end up end up
8N0IZZpF8ts,3455,01:03:47.680,01:03:49.079,tend to be tumors that end up end up being thick and end up having lots of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3456,01:03:49.079,01:03:49.089,being thick and end up having lots of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3457,01:03:49.089,01:03:52.380,being thick and end up having lots of mitosis so we can see a big nodule of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3458,01:03:52.380,01:03:52.390,mitosis so we can see a big nodule of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3459,01:03:52.390,01:03:55.049,mitosis so we can see a big nodule of melanoma like this in any type of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3460,01:03:55.049,01:03:55.059,melanoma like this in any type of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3461,01:03:55.059,01:03:56.819,melanoma like this in any type of melanoma you can see it in superficial
8N0IZZpF8ts,3462,01:03:56.819,01:03:56.829,melanoma you can see it in superficial
8N0IZZpF8ts,3463,01:03:56.829,01:03:58.710,melanoma you can see it in superficial spreading in leant to go malignant acryl
8N0IZZpF8ts,3464,01:03:58.710,01:03:58.720,spreading in leant to go malignant acryl
8N0IZZpF8ts,3465,01:03:58.720,01:04:00.510,spreading in leant to go malignant acryl indigenous so just because there is a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3466,01:04:00.510,01:04:00.520,indigenous so just because there is a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3467,01:04:00.520,01:04:03.809,indigenous so just because there is a nodule of melanoma present does not mean
8N0IZZpF8ts,3468,01:04:03.809,01:04:03.819,nodule of melanoma present does not mean
8N0IZZpF8ts,3469,01:04:03.819,01:04:06.210,nodule of melanoma present does not mean that is nodular type melanoma and I
8N0IZZpF8ts,3470,01:04:06.210,01:04:06.220,that is nodular type melanoma and I
8N0IZZpF8ts,3471,01:04:06.220,01:04:08.280,that is nodular type melanoma and I think this is kind of confusing and a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3472,01:04:08.280,01:04:08.290,think this is kind of confusing and a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3473,01:04:08.290,01:04:09.720,think this is kind of confusing and a little frustrating I thought it was

8N0IZZpF8ts,3475,01:04:09.730,01:04:10.770,little frustrating I thought it was frustrating when I learned it as a

8N0IZZpF8ts,3479,01:04:12.069,01:04:14.339,resident and I still don't fully understand why it's so important that we
8N0IZZpF8ts,3480,01:04:14.339,01:04:14.349,understand why it's so important that we
8N0IZZpF8ts,3481,01:04:14.349,01:04:15.900,understand why it's so important that we have this strict rule but what the rule
8N0IZZpF8ts,3482,01:04:15.900,01:04:15.910,have this strict rule but what the rule
8N0IZZpF8ts,3483,01:04:15.910,01:04:17.579,have this strict rule but what the rule is supposed to be is that a nodular
8N0IZZpF8ts,3484,01:04:17.579,01:04:17.589,is supposed to be is that a nodular
8N0IZZpF8ts,3485,01:04:17.589,01:04:21.150,is supposed to be is that a nodular melanoma the invasive dermal component
8N0IZZpF8ts,3486,01:04:21.150,01:04:21.160,melanoma the invasive dermal component
8N0IZZpF8ts,3487,01:04:21.160,01:04:21.680,melanoma the invasive dermal component okay
8N0IZZpF8ts,3488,01:04:21.680,01:04:21.690,okay
8N0IZZpF8ts,3489,01:04:21.690,01:04:23.750,okay we're seeing here and the overlying

8N0IZZpF8ts,3491,01:04:23.760,01:04:26.450,we're seeing here and the overlying insight to melanoma component are are
8N0IZZpF8ts,3492,01:04:26.450,01:04:26.460,insight to melanoma component are are
8N0IZZpF8ts,3493,01:04:26.460,01:04:28.160,insight to melanoma component are are aligned with each other you don't have
8N0IZZpF8ts,3494,01:04:28.160,01:04:28.170,aligned with each other you don't have
8N0IZZpF8ts,3495,01:04:28.170,01:04:30.050,aligned with each other you don't have insight to melanoma spreading out to the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3496,01:04:30.050,01:04:30.060,insight to melanoma spreading out to the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3497,01:04:30.060,01:04:32.180,insight to melanoma spreading out to the side beyond the the invasive dermal

8N0IZZpF8ts,3499,01:04:32.190,01:04:33.740,side beyond the the invasive dermal component so when we go to the edge of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3500,01:04:33.740,01:04:33.750,component so when we go to the edge of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3501,01:04:33.750,01:04:35.270,component so when we go to the edge of the nodule here what we see is here's

8N0IZZpF8ts,3505,01:04:37.070,01:04:41.330,the invasive stuff all this is invasive invasive melanoma down here and here's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3506,01:04:41.330,01:04:41.340,invasive melanoma down here and here's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3507,01:04:41.340,01:04:43.430,invasive melanoma down here and here's in-situ melanoma up here and look the

8N0IZZpF8ts,3509,01:04:43.440,01:04:45.140,in-situ melanoma up here and look the insight to stops right here the invasion
8N0IZZpF8ts,3510,01:04:45.140,01:04:45.150,insight to stops right here the invasion
8N0IZZpF8ts,3511,01:04:45.150,01:04:47.420,insight to stops right here the invasion stops here if it goes more than like
8N0IZZpF8ts,3512,01:04:47.420,01:04:47.430,stops here if it goes more than like
8N0IZZpF8ts,3513,01:04:47.430,01:04:50.480,stops here if it goes more than like three ridi beyond the edge if you can if
8N0IZZpF8ts,3514,01:04:50.480,01:04:50.490,three ridi beyond the edge if you can if
8N0IZZpF8ts,3515,01:04:50.490,01:04:52.160,three ridi beyond the edge if you can if you can see in sight to marching all the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3516,01:04:52.160,01:04:52.170,you can see in sight to marching all the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3517,01:04:52.170,01:04:52.940,you can see in sight to marching all the way out here
8N0IZZpF8ts,3518,01:04:52.940,01:04:52.950,way out here
8N0IZZpF8ts,3519,01:04:52.950,01:04:56.330,way out here multiple read original invasive

8N0IZZpF8ts,3521,01:04:56.340,01:04:58.790,multiple read original invasive component then usually it's better to
8N0IZZpF8ts,3522,01:04:58.790,01:04:58.800,component then usually it's better to
8N0IZZpF8ts,3523,01:04:58.800,01:05:01.100,component then usually it's better to classify the lesion based on the pattern
8N0IZZpF8ts,3524,01:05:01.100,01:05:01.110,classify the lesion based on the pattern
8N0IZZpF8ts,3525,01:05:01.110,01:05:02.840,classify the lesion based on the pattern of what the insight to looks like if
8N0IZZpF8ts,3526,01:05:02.840,01:05:02.850,of what the insight to looks like if
8N0IZZpF8ts,3527,01:05:02.850,01:05:04.340,of what the insight to looks like if there's lots of pageant widespread and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3528,01:05:04.340,01:05:04.350,there's lots of pageant widespread and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3529,01:05:04.350,01:05:06.410,there's lots of pageant widespread and large epithelioid cells you can say it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3530,01:05:06.410,01:05:06.420,large epithelioid cells you can say it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3531,01:05:06.420,01:05:07.910,large epithelioid cells you can say it's a superficial spreading that just has a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3532,01:05:07.910,01:05:07.920,a superficial spreading that just has a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3533,01:05:07.920,01:05:10.670,a superficial spreading that just has a large nodule of invasive melanoma that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3534,01:05:10.670,01:05:10.680,large nodule of invasive melanoma that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3535,01:05:10.680,01:05:12.440,large nodule of invasive melanoma that's grown in it again I don't personally
8N0IZZpF8ts,3536,01:05:12.440,01:05:12.450,grown in it again I don't personally
8N0IZZpF8ts,3537,01:05:12.450,01:05:14.480,grown in it again I don't personally understand why this semantics why this
8N0IZZpF8ts,3538,01:05:14.480,01:05:14.490,understand why this semantics why this
8N0IZZpF8ts,3539,01:05:14.490,01:05:16.970,understand why this semantics why this is to me this seems like semantics and I
8N0IZZpF8ts,3540,01:05:16.970,01:05:16.980,is to me this seems like semantics and I
8N0IZZpF8ts,3541,01:05:16.980,01:05:18.410,is to me this seems like semantics and I don't understand the importance I'm sure
8N0IZZpF8ts,3542,01:05:18.410,01:05:18.420,don't understand the importance I'm sure
8N0IZZpF8ts,3543,01:05:18.420,01:05:20.510,don't understand the importance I'm sure somebody much smarter than me will come
8N0IZZpF8ts,3544,01:05:20.510,01:05:20.520,somebody much smarter than me will come
8N0IZZpF8ts,3545,01:05:20.520,01:05:22.400,somebody much smarter than me will come and tell me why I'm wrong but in any
8N0IZZpF8ts,3546,01:05:22.400,01:05:22.410,and tell me why I'm wrong but in any
8N0IZZpF8ts,3547,01:05:22.410,01:05:23.600,and tell me why I'm wrong but in any case that's what the rules are supposed
8N0IZZpF8ts,3548,01:05:23.600,01:05:23.610,case that's what the rules are supposed
8N0IZZpF8ts,3549,01:05:23.610,01:05:25.700,case that's what the rules are supposed to be that the in-situ part doesn't go
8N0IZZpF8ts,3550,01:05:25.700,01:05:25.710,to be that the in-situ part doesn't go
8N0IZZpF8ts,3551,01:05:25.710,01:05:27.800,to be that the in-situ part doesn't go more than three ridi I think is the rule
8N0IZZpF8ts,3552,01:05:27.800,01:05:27.810,more than three ridi I think is the rule
8N0IZZpF8ts,3553,01:05:27.810,01:05:29.660,more than three ridi I think is the rule beyond the edge of the invasive stuff
8N0IZZpF8ts,3554,01:05:29.660,01:05:29.670,beyond the edge of the invasive stuff
8N0IZZpF8ts,3555,01:05:29.670,01:05:30.740,beyond the edge of the invasive stuff and if we look at the other edge of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3556,01:05:30.740,01:05:30.750,and if we look at the other edge of the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3557,01:05:30.750,01:05:33.740,and if we look at the other edge of the lesion here on the other side wherever

8N0IZZpF8ts,3559,01:05:33.750,01:05:35.750,lesion here on the other side wherever it is same thing we have insight to
8N0IZZpF8ts,3560,01:05:35.750,01:05:35.760,it is same thing we have insight to
8N0IZZpF8ts,3561,01:05:35.760,01:05:38.330,it is same thing we have insight to stuff here and bassists up here and the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3562,01:05:38.330,01:05:38.340,stuff here and bassists up here and the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3563,01:05:38.340,01:05:40.460,stuff here and bassists up here and the end of lesion is right there sorry it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3564,01:05:40.460,01:05:40.470,end of lesion is right there sorry it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3565,01:05:40.470,01:05:41.990,end of lesion is right there sorry it's kind of tipped at an angle but here's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3566,01:05:41.990,01:05:42.000,kind of tipped at an angle but here's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3567,01:05:42.000,01:05:47.540,kind of tipped at an angle but here's the normal skin ah I drop the slide into
8N0IZZpF8ts,3568,01:05:47.540,01:05:47.550,the normal skin ah I drop the slide into
8N0IZZpF8ts,3569,01:05:47.550,01:05:51.320,the normal skin ah I drop the slide into the microscope all right here we're
8N0IZZpF8ts,3570,01:05:51.320,01:05:51.330,the microscope all right here we're
8N0IZZpF8ts,3571,01:05:51.330,01:05:52.640,the microscope all right here we're looking at it kind of at an angle now
8N0IZZpF8ts,3572,01:05:52.640,01:05:52.650,looking at it kind of at an angle now
8N0IZZpF8ts,3573,01:05:52.650,01:05:54.800,looking at it kind of at an angle now but there this is the normal skin at the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3574,01:05:54.800,01:05:54.810,but there this is the normal skin at the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3575,01:05:54.810,01:05:56.810,but there this is the normal skin at the edge of the shave and here's where the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3576,01:05:56.810,01:05:56.820,edge of the shave and here's where the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3577,01:05:56.820,01:05:58.370,edge of the shave and here's where the melanoma starts and as you can tell this
8N0IZZpF8ts,3578,01:05:58.370,01:05:58.380,melanoma starts and as you can tell this
8N0IZZpF8ts,3579,01:05:58.380,01:06:01.400,melanoma starts and as you can tell this is a lot a large polyploid melanoma huge
8N0IZZpF8ts,3580,01:06:01.400,01:06:01.410,is a lot a large polyploid melanoma huge
8N0IZZpF8ts,3581,01:06:01.410,01:06:03.170,is a lot a large polyploid melanoma huge and it's bulging out of the the top of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3582,01:06:03.170,01:06:03.180,and it's bulging out of the the top of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3583,01:06:03.180,01:06:05.300,and it's bulging out of the the top of the skin and so we see these sometimes
8N0IZZpF8ts,3584,01:06:05.300,01:06:05.310,the skin and so we see these sometimes
8N0IZZpF8ts,3585,01:06:05.310,01:06:08.180,the skin and so we see these sometimes and oftentimes these large nodular
8N0IZZpF8ts,3586,01:06:08.180,01:06:08.190,and oftentimes these large nodular
8N0IZZpF8ts,3587,01:06:08.190,01:06:10.100,and oftentimes these large nodular melanomas that are polypoid tend to be
8N0IZZpF8ts,3588,01:06:10.100,01:06:10.110,melanomas that are polypoid tend to be
8N0IZZpF8ts,3589,01:06:10.110,01:06:12.140,melanomas that are polypoid tend to be all serrated they tend to grow quickly a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3590,01:06:12.140,01:06:12.150,all serrated they tend to grow quickly a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3591,01:06:12.150,01:06:13.520,all serrated they tend to grow quickly a lot of times they have very little
8N0IZZpF8ts,3592,01:06:13.520,01:06:13.530,lot of times they have very little
8N0IZZpF8ts,3593,01:06:13.530,01:06:15.410,lot of times they have very little pigment in them and clinically they look
8N0IZZpF8ts,3594,01:06:15.410,01:06:15.420,pigment in them and clinically they look
8N0IZZpF8ts,3595,01:06:15.420,01:06:19.640,pigment in them and clinically they look like a big red ulcerated kind of friable
8N0IZZpF8ts,3596,01:06:19.640,01:06:19.650,like a big red ulcerated kind of friable
8N0IZZpF8ts,3597,01:06:19.650,01:06:21.110,like a big red ulcerated kind of friable nodule they can look a lot like a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3598,01:06:21.110,01:06:21.120,nodule they can look a lot like a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3599,01:06:21.120,01:06:23.600,nodule they can look a lot like a pyogenic granuloma clinically so that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3600,01:06:23.600,01:06:23.610,pyogenic granuloma clinically so that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3601,01:06:23.610,01:06:25.970,pyogenic granuloma clinically so that's why most of my colleagues in dermatology
8N0IZZpF8ts,3602,01:06:25.970,01:06:25.980,why most of my colleagues in dermatology
8N0IZZpF8ts,3603,01:06:25.980,01:06:27.080,why most of my colleagues in dermatology if they see something that looks like a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3604,01:06:27.080,01:06:27.090,if they see something that looks like a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3605,01:06:27.090,01:06:28.460,if they see something that looks like a pie genic granuloma they'll usually
8N0IZZpF8ts,3606,01:06:28.460,01:06:28.470,pie genic granuloma they'll usually
8N0IZZpF8ts,3607,01:06:28.470,01:06:30.320,pie genic granuloma they'll usually biopsy it just to make sure they're not
8N0IZZpF8ts,3608,01:06:30.320,01:06:30.330,biopsy it just to make sure they're not
8N0IZZpF8ts,3609,01:06:30.330,01:06:32.720,biopsy it just to make sure they're not missing one of these kinds of lesions
8N0IZZpF8ts,3610,01:06:32.720,01:06:32.730,missing one of these kinds of lesions
8N0IZZpF8ts,3611,01:06:32.730,01:06:34.920,missing one of these kinds of lesions and here's an example also
8N0IZZpF8ts,3612,01:06:34.920,01:06:34.930,and here's an example also
8N0IZZpF8ts,3613,01:06:34.930,01:06:37.500,and here's an example also of lack of maturation look at that the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3614,01:06:37.500,01:06:37.510,of lack of maturation look at that the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3615,01:06:37.510,01:06:41.819,of lack of maturation look at that the whole dermis is filled with a uniform
8N0IZZpF8ts,3616,01:06:41.819,01:06:41.829,whole dermis is filled with a uniform
8N0IZZpF8ts,3617,01:06:41.829,01:06:44.160,whole dermis is filled with a uniform population of melanocytes you don't even
8N0IZZpF8ts,3618,01:06:44.160,01:06:44.170,population of melanocytes you don't even
8N0IZZpF8ts,3619,01:06:44.170,01:06:45.480,population of melanocytes you don't even have to look at high-power yet to see
8N0IZZpF8ts,3620,01:06:45.480,01:06:45.490,have to look at high-power yet to see
8N0IZZpF8ts,3621,01:06:45.490,01:06:47.910,have to look at high-power yet to see that you have huge massive nests and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3622,01:06:47.910,01:06:47.920,that you have huge massive nests and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3623,01:06:47.920,01:06:49.530,that you have huge massive nests and they're all packed really tightly
8N0IZZpF8ts,3624,01:06:49.530,01:06:49.540,they're all packed really tightly
8N0IZZpF8ts,3625,01:06:49.540,01:06:51.329,they're all packed really tightly together with very little intervening
8N0IZZpF8ts,3626,01:06:51.329,01:06:51.339,together with very little intervening
8N0IZZpF8ts,3627,01:06:51.339,01:06:53.460,together with very little intervening dermal collagen and the nests up here
8N0IZZpF8ts,3628,01:06:53.460,01:06:53.470,dermal collagen and the nests up here
8N0IZZpF8ts,3629,01:06:53.470,01:06:55.400,dermal collagen and the nests up here are big and large and as you go down
8N0IZZpF8ts,3630,01:06:55.400,01:06:55.410,are big and large and as you go down
8N0IZZpF8ts,3631,01:06:55.410,01:06:57.960,are big and large and as you go down there's still huge nests the whole
8N0IZZpF8ts,3632,01:06:57.960,01:06:57.970,there's still huge nests the whole
8N0IZZpF8ts,3633,01:06:57.970,01:07:01.220,there's still huge nests the whole lesion through it's like an entire solid
8N0IZZpF8ts,3634,01:07:01.220,01:07:01.230,lesion through it's like an entire solid
8N0IZZpF8ts,3635,01:07:01.230,01:07:04.950,lesion through it's like an entire solid solid sheet like packing of nest
8N0IZZpF8ts,3636,01:07:04.950,01:07:04.960,solid sheet like packing of nest
8N0IZZpF8ts,3637,01:07:04.960,01:07:07.020,solid sheet like packing of nest together each nest is kind of a sheet
8N0IZZpF8ts,3638,01:07:07.020,01:07:07.030,together each nest is kind of a sheet
8N0IZZpF8ts,3639,01:07:07.030,01:07:08.490,together each nest is kind of a sheet and all of the nests are packed closely
8N0IZZpF8ts,3640,01:07:08.490,01:07:08.500,and all of the nests are packed closely
8N0IZZpF8ts,3641,01:07:08.500,01:07:10.020,and all of the nests are packed closely together and at the top of the lesion
8N0IZZpF8ts,3642,01:07:10.020,01:07:10.030,together and at the top of the lesion
8N0IZZpF8ts,3643,01:07:10.030,01:07:11.970,together and at the top of the lesion superficially and the deepest aspect the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3644,01:07:11.970,01:07:11.980,superficially and the deepest aspect the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3645,01:07:11.980,01:07:14.010,superficially and the deepest aspect the lesion it looks almost identical let's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3646,01:07:14.010,01:07:14.020,lesion it looks almost identical let's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3647,01:07:14.020,01:07:16.950,lesion it looks almost identical let's go to higher power and look this one's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3648,01:07:16.950,01:07:16.960,go to higher power and look this one's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3649,01:07:16.960,01:07:18.420,go to higher power and look this one's got a little bit of a cracking artifact
8N0IZZpF8ts,3650,01:07:18.420,01:07:18.430,got a little bit of a cracking artifact
8N0IZZpF8ts,3651,01:07:18.430,01:07:20.579,got a little bit of a cracking artifact here in the midst of the tumor but I
8N0IZZpF8ts,3652,01:07:20.579,01:07:20.589,here in the midst of the tumor but I
8N0IZZpF8ts,3653,01:07:20.589,01:07:24.839,here in the midst of the tumor but I think we can still make the point we
8N0IZZpF8ts,3654,01:07:24.839,01:07:24.849,think we can still make the point we
8N0IZZpF8ts,3655,01:07:24.849,01:07:29.730,think we can still make the point we have really atypical melanocytes big
8N0IZZpF8ts,3656,01:07:29.730,01:07:29.740,have really atypical melanocytes big
8N0IZZpF8ts,3657,01:07:29.740,01:07:34.349,have really atypical melanocytes big nucleoli kind of vesicular chromatin in
8N0IZZpF8ts,3658,01:07:34.349,01:07:34.359,nucleoli kind of vesicular chromatin in
8N0IZZpF8ts,3659,01:07:34.359,01:07:38.849,nucleoli kind of vesicular chromatin in this case if you look around
8N0IZZpF8ts,3660,01:07:38.849,01:07:38.859,this case if you look around
8N0IZZpF8ts,3661,01:07:38.859,01:07:41.460,this case if you look around we'll start finding mitosis here's one
8N0IZZpF8ts,3662,01:07:41.460,01:07:41.470,we'll start finding mitosis here's one
8N0IZZpF8ts,3663,01:07:41.470,01:07:44.430,we'll start finding mitosis here's one right here and again usually big modular
8N0IZZpF8ts,3664,01:07:44.430,01:07:44.440,right here and again usually big modular
8N0IZZpF8ts,3665,01:07:44.440,01:07:45.990,right here and again usually big modular melanomas like this of ulceration are
8N0IZZpF8ts,3666,01:07:45.990,01:07:46.000,melanomas like this of ulceration are
8N0IZZpF8ts,3667,01:07:46.000,01:07:47.700,melanomas like this of ulceration are usually going to have many mitosis and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3668,01:07:47.700,01:07:47.710,usually going to have many mitosis and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3669,01:07:47.710,01:07:50.039,usually going to have many mitosis and in melanoma we count the mitotic rate
8N0IZZpF8ts,3670,01:07:50.039,01:07:50.049,in melanoma we count the mitotic rate
8N0IZZpF8ts,3671,01:07:50.049,01:07:52.770,in melanoma we count the mitotic rate based on the the dermal mitosis the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3672,01:07:52.770,01:07:52.780,based on the the dermal mitosis the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3673,01:07:52.780,01:07:54.480,based on the the dermal mitosis the mitosis that are in the invasive
8N0IZZpF8ts,3674,01:07:54.480,01:07:54.490,mitosis that are in the invasive
8N0IZZpF8ts,3675,01:07:54.490,01:07:56.250,mitosis that are in the invasive melanoma component and we count in one
8N0IZZpF8ts,3676,01:07:56.250,01:07:56.260,melanoma component and we count in one
8N0IZZpF8ts,3677,01:07:56.260,01:07:58.530,melanoma component and we count in one millimeter squared and that's different
8N0IZZpF8ts,3678,01:07:58.530,01:07:58.540,millimeter squared and that's different
8N0IZZpF8ts,3679,01:07:58.540,01:08:00.240,millimeter squared and that's different on every microscope we don't use the ten
8N0IZZpF8ts,3680,01:08:00.240,01:08:00.250,on every microscope we don't use the ten
8N0IZZpF8ts,3681,01:08:00.250,01:08:01.829,on every microscope we don't use the ten high-power fields like we use for many
8N0IZZpF8ts,3682,01:08:01.829,01:08:01.839,high-power fields like we use for many
8N0IZZpF8ts,3683,01:08:01.839,01:08:04.680,high-power fields like we use for many other tumors so you have to know what
8N0IZZpF8ts,3684,01:08:04.680,01:08:04.690,other tumors so you have to know what
8N0IZZpF8ts,3685,01:08:04.690,01:08:08.910,other tumors so you have to know what the how many high-power fields represent
8N0IZZpF8ts,3686,01:08:08.910,01:08:08.920,the how many high-power fields represent
8N0IZZpF8ts,3687,01:08:08.920,01:08:10.859,the how many high-power fields represent a millimeter square based on your
8N0IZZpF8ts,3688,01:08:10.859,01:08:10.869,a millimeter square based on your
8N0IZZpF8ts,3689,01:08:10.869,01:08:11.880,a millimeter square based on your microscope and there are some
8N0IZZpF8ts,3690,01:08:11.880,01:08:11.890,microscope and there are some
8N0IZZpF8ts,3691,01:08:11.890,01:08:13.530,microscope and there are some calculations online using the field
8N0IZZpF8ts,3692,01:08:13.530,01:08:13.540,calculations online using the field
8N0IZZpF8ts,3693,01:08:13.540,01:08:15.539,calculations online using the field number of the objective and some other
8N0IZZpF8ts,3694,01:08:15.539,01:08:15.549,number of the objective and some other
8N0IZZpF8ts,3695,01:08:15.549,01:08:18.090,number of the objective and some other things to calculate how much area is in
8N0IZZpF8ts,3696,01:08:18.090,01:08:18.100,things to calculate how much area is in
8N0IZZpF8ts,3697,01:08:18.100,01:08:19.919,things to calculate how much area is in a high-power field on your given scope
8N0IZZpF8ts,3698,01:08:19.919,01:08:19.929,a high-power field on your given scope
8N0IZZpF8ts,3699,01:08:19.929,01:08:22.200,a high-power field on your given scope for my personal scope it's like three
8N0IZZpF8ts,3700,01:08:22.200,01:08:22.210,for my personal scope it's like three
8N0IZZpF8ts,3701,01:08:22.210,01:08:23.700,for my personal scope it's like three and a half high-power fields but again
8N0IZZpF8ts,3702,01:08:23.700,01:08:23.710,and a half high-power fields but again
8N0IZZpF8ts,3703,01:08:23.710,01:08:24.809,and a half high-power fields but again you can't use that you've got to go
8N0IZZpF8ts,3704,01:08:24.809,01:08:24.819,you can't use that you've got to go
8N0IZZpF8ts,3705,01:08:24.819,01:08:26.720,you can't use that you've got to go calculate it for your own microscope and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3706,01:08:26.720,01:08:26.730,calculate it for your own microscope and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3707,01:08:26.730,01:08:29.729,calculate it for your own microscope and and then you count the mitosis and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3708,01:08:29.729,01:08:29.739,and then you count the mitosis and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3709,01:08:29.739,01:08:31.680,and then you count the mitosis and usually what I do is I'll find the area
8N0IZZpF8ts,3710,01:08:31.680,01:08:31.690,usually what I do is I'll find the area
8N0IZZpF8ts,3711,01:08:31.690,01:08:33.329,usually what I do is I'll find the area that looks most active like oh here's an
8N0IZZpF8ts,3712,01:08:33.329,01:08:33.339,that looks most active like oh here's an
8N0IZZpF8ts,3713,01:08:33.339,01:08:37.590,that looks most active like oh here's an area I've got at least two here so we
8N0IZZpF8ts,3714,01:08:37.590,01:08:37.600,area I've got at least two here so we
8N0IZZpF8ts,3715,01:08:37.600,01:08:39.470,area I've got at least two here so we can find this area we can say okay one
8N0IZZpF8ts,3716,01:08:39.470,01:08:39.480,can find this area we can say okay one
8N0IZZpF8ts,3717,01:08:39.480,01:08:42.150,can find this area we can say okay one two mitosis and then I'll move to an
8N0IZZpF8ts,3718,01:08:42.150,01:08:42.160,two mitosis and then I'll move to an
8N0IZZpF8ts,3719,01:08:42.160,01:08:43.890,two mitosis and then I'll move to an adjacent high power field and I'll count
8N0IZZpF8ts,3720,01:08:43.890,01:08:43.900,adjacent high power field and I'll count
8N0IZZpF8ts,3721,01:08:43.900,01:08:45.950,adjacent high power field and I'll count there and then another field and I count
8N0IZZpF8ts,3722,01:08:45.950,01:08:45.960,there and then another field and I count
8N0IZZpF8ts,3723,01:08:45.960,01:08:47.090,there and then another field and I count three and a half fields that way and I
8N0IZZpF8ts,3724,01:08:47.090,01:08:47.100,three and a half fields that way and I
8N0IZZpF8ts,3725,01:08:47.100,01:08:48.829,three and a half fields that way and I add that together and that's how I make
8N0IZZpF8ts,3726,01:08:48.829,01:08:48.839,add that together and that's how I make
8N0IZZpF8ts,3727,01:08:48.839,01:08:54.170,add that together and that's how I make my mitotic count and for details about
8N0IZZpF8ts,3728,01:08:54.170,01:08:54.180,my mitotic count and for details about
8N0IZZpF8ts,3729,01:08:54.180,01:08:56.209,my mitotic count and for details about staging and these change from time to
8N0IZZpF8ts,3730,01:08:56.209,01:08:56.219,staging and these change from time to
8N0IZZpF8ts,3731,01:08:56.219,01:08:58.880,staging and these change from time to time you can look at the AJC see cancer
8N0IZZpF8ts,3732,01:08:58.880,01:08:58.890,time you can look at the AJC see cancer
8N0IZZpF8ts,3733,01:08:58.890,01:09:00.979,time you can look at the AJC see cancer staging manual and we just had a change
8N0IZZpF8ts,3734,01:09:00.979,01:09:00.989,staging manual and we just had a change
8N0IZZpF8ts,3735,01:09:00.989,01:09:03.019,staging manual and we just had a change back in January from the seventh edition
8N0IZZpF8ts,3736,01:09:03.019,01:09:03.029,back in January from the seventh edition
8N0IZZpF8ts,3737,01:09:03.029,01:09:06.140,back in January from the seventh edition to the eighth edition and a few things
8N0IZZpF8ts,3738,01:09:06.140,01:09:06.150,to the eighth edition and a few things
8N0IZZpF8ts,3739,01:09:06.150,01:09:08.240,to the eighth edition and a few things change and so so I'm not gonna go really
8N0IZZpF8ts,3740,01:09:08.240,01:09:08.250,change and so so I'm not gonna go really
8N0IZZpF8ts,3741,01:09:08.250,01:09:10.099,change and so so I'm not gonna go really in depth into all the staging parameters
8N0IZZpF8ts,3742,01:09:10.099,01:09:10.109,in depth into all the staging parameters
8N0IZZpF8ts,3743,01:09:10.109,01:09:11.840,in depth into all the staging parameters here because they do change and their
8N0IZZpF8ts,3744,01:09:11.840,01:09:11.850,here because they do change and their
8N0IZZpF8ts,3745,01:09:11.850,01:09:13.400,here because they do change and their significance clinically changes from
8N0IZZpF8ts,3746,01:09:13.400,01:09:13.410,significance clinically changes from
8N0IZZpF8ts,3747,01:09:13.410,01:09:15.079,significance clinically changes from time to time so whenever you're watching
8N0IZZpF8ts,3748,01:09:15.079,01:09:15.089,time to time so whenever you're watching
8N0IZZpF8ts,3749,01:09:15.089,01:09:16.910,time to time so whenever you're watching this video you can go and look up the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3750,01:09:16.910,01:09:16.920,this video you can go and look up the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3751,01:09:16.920,01:09:18.650,this video you can go and look up the most recent version of the AJCC
8N0IZZpF8ts,3752,01:09:18.650,01:09:18.660,most recent version of the AJCC
8N0IZZpF8ts,3753,01:09:18.660,01:09:20.420,most recent version of the AJCC and see what the current stage in
8N0IZZpF8ts,3754,01:09:20.420,01:09:20.430,and see what the current stage in
8N0IZZpF8ts,3755,01:09:20.430,01:09:23.690,and see what the current stage in practice is okay so again looking all
8N0IZZpF8ts,3756,01:09:23.690,01:09:23.700,practice is okay so again looking all
8N0IZZpF8ts,3757,01:09:23.700,01:09:25.190,practice is okay so again looking all the way here we're now here down at the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3758,01:09:25.190,01:09:25.200,the way here we're now here down at the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3759,01:09:25.200,01:09:27.470,the way here we're now here down at the very bottom of the lesion and just like
8N0IZZpF8ts,3760,01:09:27.470,01:09:27.480,very bottom of the lesion and just like
8N0IZZpF8ts,3761,01:09:27.480,01:09:29.539,very bottom of the lesion and just like at the top we've got big Ness
8N0IZZpF8ts,3762,01:09:29.539,01:09:29.549,at the top we've got big Ness
8N0IZZpF8ts,3763,01:09:29.549,01:09:31.340,at the top we've got big Ness filled with atypical cells and look
8N0IZZpF8ts,3764,01:09:31.340,01:09:31.350,filled with atypical cells and look
8N0IZZpF8ts,3765,01:09:31.350,01:09:34.309,filled with atypical cells and look mitosis mitosis
8N0IZZpF8ts,3766,01:09:34.309,01:09:34.319,mitosis mitosis
8N0IZZpF8ts,3767,01:09:34.319,01:09:37.880,mitosis mitosis I got mitosis and atypia everywhere even
8N0IZZpF8ts,3768,01:09:37.880,01:09:37.890,I got mitosis and atypia everywhere even
8N0IZZpF8ts,3769,01:09:37.890,01:09:39.320,I got mitosis and atypia everywhere even down the deep part of the légion look
8N0IZZpF8ts,3770,01:09:39.320,01:09:39.330,down the deep part of the légion look
8N0IZZpF8ts,3771,01:09:39.330,01:09:40.729,down the deep part of the légion look this looks even uglier than the top of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3772,01:09:40.729,01:09:40.739,this looks even uglier than the top of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3773,01:09:40.739,01:09:43.670,this looks even uglier than the top of the lesion it's like larger and more
8N0IZZpF8ts,3774,01:09:43.670,01:09:43.680,the lesion it's like larger and more
8N0IZZpF8ts,3775,01:09:43.680,01:09:45.289,the lesion it's like larger and more atypical than the cells even at the top
8N0IZZpF8ts,3776,01:09:45.289,01:09:45.299,atypical than the cells even at the top
8N0IZZpF8ts,3777,01:09:45.299,01:09:46.610,atypical than the cells even at the top and we're all the way down in the deep
8N0IZZpF8ts,3778,01:09:46.610,01:09:46.620,and we're all the way down in the deep
8N0IZZpF8ts,3779,01:09:46.620,01:09:49.300,and we're all the way down in the deep dermis so this is a great example of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3780,01:09:49.300,01:09:49.310,dermis so this is a great example of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3781,01:09:49.310,01:09:51.920,dermis so this is a great example of abnormal maturation where you have
8N0IZZpF8ts,3782,01:09:51.920,01:09:51.930,abnormal maturation where you have
8N0IZZpF8ts,3783,01:09:51.930,01:09:54.800,abnormal maturation where you have larger and even more atypical cells down
8N0IZZpF8ts,3784,01:09:54.800,01:09:54.810,larger and even more atypical cells down
8N0IZZpF8ts,3785,01:09:54.810,01:09:57.170,larger and even more atypical cells down to the deep aspect then you even had at
8N0IZZpF8ts,3786,01:09:57.170,01:09:57.180,to the deep aspect then you even had at
8N0IZZpF8ts,3787,01:09:57.180,01:09:57.770,to the deep aspect then you even had at the top
8N0IZZpF8ts,3788,01:09:57.770,01:09:57.780,the top
8N0IZZpF8ts,3789,01:09:57.780,01:10:05.360,the top okay so nodular melanoma now one last
8N0IZZpF8ts,3790,01:10:05.360,01:10:05.370,okay so nodular melanoma now one last
8N0IZZpF8ts,3791,01:10:05.370,01:10:06.440,okay so nodular melanoma now one last thing I'll say is if you see something
8N0IZZpF8ts,3792,01:10:06.440,01:10:06.450,thing I'll say is if you see something
8N0IZZpF8ts,3793,01:10:06.450,01:10:12.189,thing I'll say is if you see something that looks like a naja melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,3794,01:10:14.200,01:10:14.210,like this kind of looks like one a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3795,01:10:14.210,01:10:16.330,like this kind of looks like one a little bit not nearly as big as the last
8N0IZZpF8ts,3796,01:10:16.330,01:10:16.340,little bit not nearly as big as the last
8N0IZZpF8ts,3797,01:10:16.340,01:10:18.910,little bit not nearly as big as the last minutes it's a little nodule of melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,3798,01:10:18.910,01:10:18.920,minutes it's a little nodule of melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,3799,01:10:18.920,01:10:20.950,minutes it's a little nodule of melanoma here in the dermis and it's got lots of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3800,01:10:20.950,01:10:20.960,here in the dermis and it's got lots of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3801,01:10:20.960,01:10:23.740,here in the dermis and it's got lots of atypia and mitosis but look what it
8N0IZZpF8ts,3802,01:10:23.740,01:10:23.750,atypia and mitosis but look what it
8N0IZZpF8ts,3803,01:10:23.750,01:10:24.970,atypia and mitosis but look what it doesn't have it doesn't have any
8N0IZZpF8ts,3804,01:10:24.970,01:10:24.980,doesn't have it doesn't have any
8N0IZZpF8ts,3805,01:10:24.980,01:10:26.380,doesn't have it doesn't have any involvement of the epidermis it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3806,01:10:26.380,01:10:26.390,involvement of the epidermis it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3807,01:10:26.390,01:10:29.700,involvement of the epidermis it's filling up the papillary dermis here and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3808,01:10:29.700,01:10:29.710,filling up the papillary dermis here and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3809,01:10:29.710,01:10:31.810,filling up the papillary dermis here and doesn't have any insight to component
8N0IZZpF8ts,3810,01:10:31.810,01:10:31.820,doesn't have any insight to component
8N0IZZpF8ts,3811,01:10:31.820,01:10:35.470,doesn't have any insight to component overtop of it so when you see that you
8N0IZZpF8ts,3812,01:10:35.470,01:10:35.480,overtop of it so when you see that you
8N0IZZpF8ts,3813,01:10:35.480,01:10:37.120,overtop of it so when you see that you have to think about a metastatic lesion
8N0IZZpF8ts,3814,01:10:37.120,01:10:37.130,have to think about a metastatic lesion
8N0IZZpF8ts,3815,01:10:37.130,01:10:39.130,have to think about a metastatic lesion or a recurrent lesion melanoma that has
8N0IZZpF8ts,3816,01:10:39.130,01:10:39.140,or a recurrent lesion melanoma that has
8N0IZZpF8ts,3817,01:10:39.140,01:10:41.470,or a recurrent lesion melanoma that has been biopsied or surgically removed and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3818,01:10:41.470,01:10:41.480,been biopsied or surgically removed and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3819,01:10:41.480,01:10:44.560,been biopsied or surgically removed and then recurs in the scar or satellite
8N0IZZpF8ts,3820,01:10:44.560,01:10:44.570,then recurs in the scar or satellite
8N0IZZpF8ts,3821,01:10:44.570,01:10:47.080,then recurs in the scar or satellite lesions like little mini metastases that
8N0IZZpF8ts,3822,01:10:47.080,01:10:47.090,lesions like little mini metastases that
8N0IZZpF8ts,3823,01:10:47.090,01:10:49.180,lesions like little mini metastases that are on their way to the regional lymph
8N0IZZpF8ts,3824,01:10:49.180,01:10:49.190,are on their way to the regional lymph
8N0IZZpF8ts,3825,01:10:49.190,01:10:50.890,are on their way to the regional lymph node we call those either satellites or
8N0IZZpF8ts,3826,01:10:50.890,01:10:50.900,node we call those either satellites or
8N0IZZpF8ts,3827,01:10:50.900,01:10:53.169,node we call those either satellites or in transit metastasis or distant
8N0IZZpF8ts,3828,01:10:53.169,01:10:53.179,in transit metastasis or distant
8N0IZZpF8ts,3829,01:10:53.179,01:10:54.880,in transit metastasis or distant metastasis melanoma likes to metastasize
8N0IZZpF8ts,3830,01:10:54.880,01:10:54.890,metastasis melanoma likes to metastasize
8N0IZZpF8ts,3831,01:10:54.890,01:10:56.650,metastasis melanoma likes to metastasize to the skin it will go to lymph nodes
8N0IZZpF8ts,3832,01:10:56.650,01:10:56.660,to the skin it will go to lymph nodes
8N0IZZpF8ts,3833,01:10:56.660,01:10:58.209,to the skin it will go to lymph nodes and other sites but it also will tend to
8N0IZZpF8ts,3834,01:10:58.209,01:10:58.219,and other sites but it also will tend to
8N0IZZpF8ts,3835,01:10:58.219,01:10:59.530,and other sites but it also will tend to show up in the skin elsewhere on the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3836,01:10:59.530,01:10:59.540,show up in the skin elsewhere on the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3837,01:10:59.540,01:11:02.620,show up in the skin elsewhere on the body when melanoma either recurs locally
8N0IZZpF8ts,3838,01:11:02.620,01:11:02.630,body when melanoma either recurs locally
8N0IZZpF8ts,3839,01:11:02.630,01:11:05.290,body when melanoma either recurs locally or has a satellite or metastasizes to
8N0IZZpF8ts,3840,01:11:05.290,01:11:05.300,or has a satellite or metastasizes to
8N0IZZpF8ts,3841,01:11:05.300,01:11:07.750,or has a satellite or metastasizes to the skin it will usually fill the dermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,3842,01:11:07.750,01:11:07.760,the skin it will usually fill the dermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,3843,01:11:07.760,01:11:10.330,the skin it will usually fill the dermis sometimes also the sub-q tiss but will
8N0IZZpF8ts,3844,01:11:10.330,01:11:10.340,sometimes also the sub-q tiss but will
8N0IZZpF8ts,3845,01:11:10.340,01:11:12.550,sometimes also the sub-q tiss but will not usually involve the epidermis so the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3846,01:11:12.550,01:11:12.560,not usually involve the epidermis so the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3847,01:11:12.560,01:11:14.169,not usually involve the epidermis so the lack of an insight to component is a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3848,01:11:14.169,01:11:14.179,lack of an insight to component is a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3849,01:11:14.179,01:11:15.669,lack of an insight to component is a useful clue that you might be dealing
8N0IZZpF8ts,3850,01:11:15.669,01:11:15.679,useful clue that you might be dealing
8N0IZZpF8ts,3851,01:11:15.679,01:11:18.640,useful clue that you might be dealing with a metastatic melanoma okay and in
8N0IZZpF8ts,3852,01:11:18.640,01:11:18.650,with a metastatic melanoma okay and in
8N0IZZpF8ts,3853,01:11:18.650,01:11:20.010,with a metastatic melanoma okay and in this case this was actually a satellite
8N0IZZpF8ts,3854,01:11:20.010,01:11:20.020,this case this was actually a satellite
8N0IZZpF8ts,3855,01:11:20.020,01:11:22.689,this case this was actually a satellite leader I think and in transit metastasis
8N0IZZpF8ts,3856,01:11:22.689,01:11:22.699,leader I think and in transit metastasis
8N0IZZpF8ts,3857,01:11:22.699,01:11:24.400,leader I think and in transit metastasis and the difference between that in
8N0IZZpF8ts,3858,01:11:24.400,01:11:24.410,and the difference between that in
8N0IZZpF8ts,3859,01:11:24.410,01:11:26.890,and the difference between that in transit Met and satellite is is based on
8N0IZZpF8ts,3860,01:11:26.890,01:11:26.900,transit Met and satellite is is based on
8N0IZZpF8ts,3861,01:11:26.900,01:11:28.720,transit Met and satellite is is based on how far from the lesion how big and you
8N0IZZpF8ts,3862,01:11:28.720,01:11:28.730,how far from the lesion how big and you
8N0IZZpF8ts,3863,01:11:28.730,01:11:30.459,how far from the lesion how big and you can again look in the AJC see cancer
8N0IZZpF8ts,3864,01:11:30.459,01:11:30.469,can again look in the AJC see cancer
8N0IZZpF8ts,3865,01:11:30.469,01:11:32.320,can again look in the AJC see cancer manual they both indicate the same thing
8N0IZZpF8ts,3866,01:11:32.320,01:11:32.330,manual they both indicate the same thing
8N0IZZpF8ts,3867,01:11:32.330,01:11:34.300,manual they both indicate the same thing melanoma is spreading from the primary
8N0IZZpF8ts,3868,01:11:34.300,01:11:34.310,melanoma is spreading from the primary
8N0IZZpF8ts,3869,01:11:34.310,01:11:37.180,melanoma is spreading from the primary tumor site into or on its way towards
8N0IZZpF8ts,3870,01:11:37.180,01:11:37.190,tumor site into or on its way towards
8N0IZZpF8ts,3871,01:11:37.190,01:11:38.350,tumor site into or on its way towards the lymph node and here there's a couple
8N0IZZpF8ts,3872,01:11:38.350,01:11:38.360,the lymph node and here there's a couple
8N0IZZpF8ts,3873,01:11:38.360,01:11:39.820,the lymph node and here there's a couple of nests push right up in the papillary
8N0IZZpF8ts,3874,01:11:39.820,01:11:39.830,of nests push right up in the papillary
8N0IZZpF8ts,3875,01:11:39.830,01:11:41.350,of nests push right up in the papillary dermis but they're still not in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3876,01:11:41.350,01:11:41.360,dermis but they're still not in the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3877,01:11:41.360,01:11:44.620,dermis but they're still not in the actual epidermis okay and so that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3878,01:11:44.620,01:11:44.630,actual epidermis okay and so that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3879,01:11:44.630,01:11:47.140,actual epidermis okay and so that's metastatic melanoma or or a satellite
8N0IZZpF8ts,3880,01:11:47.140,01:11:47.150,metastatic melanoma or or a satellite
8N0IZZpF8ts,3881,01:11:47.150,01:11:48.820,metastatic melanoma or or a satellite lesion can both look like this and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3882,01:11:48.820,01:11:48.830,lesion can both look like this and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3883,01:11:48.830,01:11:50.770,lesion can both look like this and recurrent melanoma if it's in the scar
8N0IZZpF8ts,3884,01:11:50.770,01:11:50.780,recurrent melanoma if it's in the scar
8N0IZZpF8ts,3885,01:11:50.780,01:11:52.510,recurrent melanoma if it's in the scar or right next to the scar of a previous
8N0IZZpF8ts,3886,01:11:52.510,01:11:52.520,or right next to the scar of a previous
8N0IZZpF8ts,3887,01:11:52.520,01:11:54.490,or right next to the scar of a previous melanoma surgery and you see a nodule of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3888,01:11:54.490,01:11:54.500,melanoma surgery and you see a nodule of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3889,01:11:54.500,01:11:55.990,melanoma surgery and you see a nodule of melanoma pop up and then that's a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3890,01:11:55.990,01:11:56.000,melanoma pop up and then that's a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3891,01:11:56.000,01:11:57.669,melanoma pop up and then that's a recurrence the reason it's important to
8N0IZZpF8ts,3892,01:11:57.669,01:11:57.679,recurrence the reason it's important to
8N0IZZpF8ts,3893,01:11:57.679,01:11:59.080,recurrence the reason it's important to know this pattern is number one if this
8N0IZZpF8ts,3894,01:11:59.080,01:11:59.090,know this pattern is number one if this
8N0IZZpF8ts,3895,01:11:59.090,01:12:00.520,know this pattern is number one if this is the first melanoma you're seeing from
8N0IZZpF8ts,3896,01:12:00.520,01:12:00.530,is the first melanoma you're seeing from
8N0IZZpF8ts,3897,01:12:00.530,01:12:02.890,is the first melanoma you're seeing from the patient it's worth talking to the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3898,01:12:02.890,01:12:02.900,the patient it's worth talking to the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3899,01:12:02.900,01:12:04.630,the patient it's worth talking to the dermatologist and saying hey could this
8N0IZZpF8ts,3900,01:12:04.630,01:12:04.640,dermatologist and saying hey could this
8N0IZZpF8ts,3901,01:12:04.640,01:12:06.430,dermatologist and saying hey could this be a metastatic lesion sometimes
8N0IZZpF8ts,3902,01:12:06.430,01:12:06.440,be a metastatic lesion sometimes
8N0IZZpF8ts,3903,01:12:06.440,01:12:07.959,be a metastatic lesion sometimes patients will have had a lesion biopsied
8N0IZZpF8ts,3904,01:12:07.959,01:12:07.969,patients will have had a lesion biopsied
8N0IZZpF8ts,3905,01:12:07.969,01:12:09.310,patients will have had a lesion biopsied a long time ago and they forgot that
8N0IZZpF8ts,3906,01:12:09.310,01:12:09.320,a long time ago and they forgot that
8N0IZZpF8ts,3907,01:12:09.320,01:12:11.470,a long time ago and they forgot that about it and it's hard to believe but
8N0IZZpF8ts,3908,01:12:11.470,01:12:11.480,about it and it's hard to believe but
8N0IZZpF8ts,3909,01:12:11.480,01:12:12.760,about it and it's hard to believe but it's true patient sometimes forget that
8N0IZZpF8ts,3910,01:12:12.760,01:12:12.770,it's true patient sometimes forget that
8N0IZZpF8ts,3911,01:12:12.770,01:12:14.650,it's true patient sometimes forget that they used to that they had cancer at one
8N0IZZpF8ts,3912,01:12:14.650,01:12:14.660,they used to that they had cancer at one
8N0IZZpF8ts,3913,01:12:14.660,01:12:16.030,they used to that they had cancer at one point or forget that they had a biopsy
8N0IZZpF8ts,3914,01:12:16.030,01:12:16.040,point or forget that they had a biopsy
8N0IZZpF8ts,3915,01:12:16.040,01:12:18.340,point or forget that they had a biopsy that maybe got thrown away and not sent
8N0IZZpF8ts,3916,01:12:18.340,01:12:18.350,that maybe got thrown away and not sent
8N0IZZpF8ts,3917,01:12:18.350,01:12:19.810,that maybe got thrown away and not sent to the lab I know that's shocking but I
8N0IZZpF8ts,3918,01:12:19.810,01:12:19.820,to the lab I know that's shocking but I
8N0IZZpF8ts,3919,01:12:19.820,01:12:21.400,to the lab I know that's shocking but I have seen cases like that it's very
8N0IZZpF8ts,3920,01:12:21.400,01:12:21.410,have seen cases like that it's very
8N0IZZpF8ts,3921,01:12:21.410,01:12:22.800,have seen cases like that it's very tragic
8N0IZZpF8ts,3922,01:12:22.800,01:12:22.810,tragic
8N0IZZpF8ts,3923,01:12:22.810,01:12:24.939,tragic also sometimes a patient has a known
8N0IZZpF8ts,3924,01:12:24.939,01:12:24.949,also sometimes a patient has a known
8N0IZZpF8ts,3925,01:12:24.949,01:12:25.930,also sometimes a patient has a known history they just haven't met
8N0IZZpF8ts,3926,01:12:25.930,01:12:25.940,history they just haven't met
8N0IZZpF8ts,3927,01:12:25.940,01:12:28.420,history they just haven't met to their doctor and sometimes we see
8N0IZZpF8ts,3928,01:12:28.420,01:12:28.430,to their doctor and sometimes we see
8N0IZZpF8ts,3929,01:12:28.430,01:12:29.410,to their doctor and sometimes we see something that looks like a metastasis
8N0IZZpF8ts,3930,01:12:29.410,01:12:29.420,something that looks like a metastasis
8N0IZZpF8ts,3931,01:12:29.420,01:12:32.320,something that looks like a metastasis and after close full-body skin exam
8N0IZZpF8ts,3932,01:12:32.320,01:12:32.330,and after close full-body skin exam
8N0IZZpF8ts,3933,01:12:32.330,01:12:34.870,and after close full-body skin exam another area will be found that actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,3934,01:12:34.870,01:12:34.880,another area will be found that actually
8N0IZZpF8ts,3935,01:12:34.880,01:12:36.729,another area will be found that actually was the primary melanoma or the primary
8N0IZZpF8ts,3936,01:12:36.729,01:12:36.739,was the primary melanoma or the primary
8N0IZZpF8ts,3937,01:12:36.739,01:12:38.350,was the primary melanoma or the primary melanoma may have been present but it
8N0IZZpF8ts,3938,01:12:38.350,01:12:38.360,melanoma may have been present but it
8N0IZZpF8ts,3939,01:12:38.360,01:12:40.150,melanoma may have been present but it regressed away completely and only the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3940,01:12:40.150,01:12:40.160,regressed away completely and only the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3941,01:12:40.160,01:12:42.280,regressed away completely and only the metastasis is left or the patient picked
8N0IZZpF8ts,3942,01:12:42.280,01:12:42.290,metastasis is left or the patient picked
8N0IZZpF8ts,3943,01:12:42.290,01:12:44.260,metastasis is left or the patient picked at it until it you know fell off their
8N0IZZpF8ts,3944,01:12:44.260,01:12:44.270,at it until it you know fell off their
8N0IZZpF8ts,3945,01:12:44.270,01:12:45.610,at it until it you know fell off their skin so they kind of treated it with
8N0IZZpF8ts,3946,01:12:45.610,01:12:45.620,skin so they kind of treated it with
8N0IZZpF8ts,3947,01:12:45.620,01:12:48.040,skin so they kind of treated it with their own fingernail picking and yet
8N0IZZpF8ts,3948,01:12:48.040,01:12:48.050,their own fingernail picking and yet
8N0IZZpF8ts,3949,01:12:48.050,01:12:49.630,their own fingernail picking and yet still it developed a metastasis I've
8N0IZZpF8ts,3950,01:12:49.630,01:12:49.640,still it developed a metastasis I've
8N0IZZpF8ts,3951,01:12:49.640,01:12:51.700,still it developed a metastasis I've seen all of those different scenarios so
8N0IZZpF8ts,3952,01:12:51.700,01:12:51.710,seen all of those different scenarios so
8N0IZZpF8ts,3953,01:12:51.710,01:12:53.200,seen all of those different scenarios so it's worth bringing up I've also seen
8N0IZZpF8ts,3954,01:12:53.200,01:12:53.210,it's worth bringing up I've also seen
8N0IZZpF8ts,3955,01:12:53.210,01:12:54.790,it's worth bringing up I've also seen times where we just have a big nodular
8N0IZZpF8ts,3956,01:12:54.790,01:12:54.800,times where we just have a big nodular
8N0IZZpF8ts,3957,01:12:54.800,01:12:57.729,times where we just have a big nodular melanoma where either through the level
8N0IZZpF8ts,3958,01:12:57.729,01:12:57.739,melanoma where either through the level
8N0IZZpF8ts,3959,01:12:57.739,01:12:59.830,melanoma where either through the level of sectioning or due to a lot of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3960,01:12:59.830,01:12:59.840,of sectioning or due to a lot of
8N0IZZpF8ts,3961,01:12:59.840,01:13:02.020,of sectioning or due to a lot of ulceration the in-situ components just
8N0IZZpF8ts,3962,01:13:02.020,01:13:02.030,ulceration the in-situ components just
8N0IZZpF8ts,3963,01:13:02.030,01:13:04.300,ulceration the in-situ components just not visualized but clinically after
8N0IZZpF8ts,3964,01:13:04.300,01:13:04.310,not visualized but clinically after
8N0IZZpF8ts,3965,01:13:04.310,01:13:07.030,not visualized but clinically after thorough workup the most logical thing
8N0IZZpF8ts,3966,01:13:07.030,01:13:07.040,thorough workup the most logical thing
8N0IZZpF8ts,3967,01:13:07.040,01:13:09.459,thorough workup the most logical thing is that it's a big primary melanoma even
8N0IZZpF8ts,3968,01:13:09.459,01:13:09.469,is that it's a big primary melanoma even
8N0IZZpF8ts,3969,01:13:09.469,01:13:10.479,is that it's a big primary melanoma even though we don't see an insight to
8N0IZZpF8ts,3970,01:13:10.479,01:13:10.489,though we don't see an insight to
8N0IZZpF8ts,3971,01:13:10.489,01:13:12.459,though we don't see an insight to components so it's worth thinking about
8N0IZZpF8ts,3972,01:13:12.459,01:13:12.469,components so it's worth thinking about
8N0IZZpF8ts,3973,01:13:12.469,01:13:13.750,components so it's worth thinking about when you see melanoma in the dermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,3974,01:13:13.750,01:13:13.760,when you see melanoma in the dermis
8N0IZZpF8ts,3975,01:13:13.760,01:13:15.070,when you see melanoma in the dermis without an insight to component think
8N0IZZpF8ts,3976,01:13:15.070,01:13:15.080,without an insight to component think
8N0IZZpF8ts,3977,01:13:15.080,01:13:18.280,without an insight to component think about a metastasis and and think and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3978,01:13:18.280,01:13:18.290,about a metastasis and and think and
8N0IZZpF8ts,3979,01:13:18.290,01:13:19.720,about a metastasis and and think and discuss with the surgeons or the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3980,01:13:19.720,01:13:19.730,discuss with the surgeons or the
8N0IZZpF8ts,3981,01:13:19.730,01:13:21.970,discuss with the surgeons or the dermatologists to see if that's a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3982,01:13:21.970,01:13:21.980,dermatologists to see if that's a
8N0IZZpF8ts,3983,01:13:21.980,01:13:24.640,dermatologists to see if that's a possibility but but just because it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3984,01:13:24.640,01:13:24.650,possibility but but just because it's
8N0IZZpF8ts,3985,01:13:24.650,01:13:26.110,possibility but but just because it's missing an insight to component doesn't
8N0IZZpF8ts,3986,01:13:26.110,01:13:26.120,missing an insight to component doesn't
8N0IZZpF8ts,3987,01:13:26.120,01:13:27.790,missing an insight to component doesn't necessarily prove that it's a metastasis
8N0IZZpF8ts,3988,01:13:27.790,01:13:27.800,necessarily prove that it's a metastasis
8N0IZZpF8ts,3989,01:13:27.800,01:13:30.939,necessarily prove that it's a metastasis also metastatic melanoma and recurrent
8N0IZZpF8ts,3990,01:13:30.939,01:13:30.949,also metastatic melanoma and recurrent
8N0IZZpF8ts,3991,01:13:30.949,01:13:33.130,also metastatic melanoma and recurrent melanoma sometimes can grow back up into
8N0IZZpF8ts,3992,01:13:33.130,01:13:33.140,melanoma sometimes can grow back up into
8N0IZZpF8ts,3993,01:13:33.140,01:13:34.810,melanoma sometimes can grow back up into the epidermis and mimic a primary
8N0IZZpF8ts,3994,01:13:34.810,01:13:34.820,the epidermis and mimic a primary
8N0IZZpF8ts,3995,01:13:34.820,01:13:36.220,the epidermis and mimic a primary melanoma it can look like it has an
8N0IZZpF8ts,3996,01:13:36.220,01:13:36.230,melanoma it can look like it has an
8N0IZZpF8ts,3997,01:13:36.230,01:13:37.450,melanoma it can look like it has an insight to component we call those
8N0IZZpF8ts,3998,01:13:37.450,01:13:37.460,insight to component we call those
8N0IZZpF8ts,3999,01:13:37.460,01:13:39.820,insight to component we call those epidermal tropic Mets so this one
8N0IZZpF8ts,4000,01:13:39.820,01:13:39.830,epidermal tropic Mets so this one
8N0IZZpF8ts,4001,01:13:39.830,01:13:41.200,epidermal tropic Mets so this one doesn't have that but this is a nice
8N0IZZpF8ts,4002,01:13:41.200,01:13:41.210,doesn't have that but this is a nice
8N0IZZpF8ts,4003,01:13:41.210,01:13:43.959,doesn't have that but this is a nice example of a pattern that you can see in
8N0IZZpF8ts,4004,01:13:43.959,01:13:43.969,example of a pattern that you can see in
8N0IZZpF8ts,4005,01:13:43.969,01:13:46.120,example of a pattern that you can see in metastatic melanoma and if you don't
8N0IZZpF8ts,4006,01:13:46.120,01:13:46.130,metastatic melanoma and if you don't
8N0IZZpF8ts,4007,01:13:46.130,01:13:47.380,metastatic melanoma and if you don't believe me that's melanoma on high
8N0IZZpF8ts,4008,01:13:47.380,01:13:47.390,believe me that's melanoma on high
8N0IZZpF8ts,4009,01:13:47.390,01:13:49.270,believe me that's melanoma on high powered there's lots of atypia mitotic
8N0IZZpF8ts,4010,01:13:49.270,01:13:49.280,powered there's lots of atypia mitotic
8N0IZZpF8ts,4011,01:13:49.280,01:13:50.920,powered there's lots of atypia mitotic activity and again there was a known
8N0IZZpF8ts,4012,01:13:50.920,01:13:50.930,activity and again there was a known
8N0IZZpF8ts,4013,01:13:50.930,01:13:54.430,activity and again there was a known melanoma nearby okay so remember that if
8N0IZZpF8ts,4014,01:13:54.430,01:13:54.440,melanoma nearby okay so remember that if
8N0IZZpF8ts,4015,01:13:54.440,01:13:56.620,melanoma nearby okay so remember that if there's not epidermal involvement think
8N0IZZpF8ts,4016,01:13:56.620,01:13:56.630,there's not epidermal involvement think
8N0IZZpF8ts,4017,01:13:56.630,01:13:58.120,there's not epidermal involvement think about the possibility of a met or
8N0IZZpF8ts,4018,01:13:58.120,01:13:58.130,about the possibility of a met or
8N0IZZpF8ts,4019,01:13:58.130,01:13:59.950,about the possibility of a met or recurrence the other important reason to
8N0IZZpF8ts,4020,01:13:59.950,01:13:59.960,recurrence the other important reason to
8N0IZZpF8ts,4021,01:13:59.960,01:14:01.390,recurrence the other important reason to know about that is if it's a metastasis
8N0IZZpF8ts,4022,01:14:01.390,01:14:01.400,know about that is if it's a metastasis
8N0IZZpF8ts,4023,01:14:01.400,01:14:04.450,know about that is if it's a metastasis or a satellite or a recurrent melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,4024,01:14:04.450,01:14:04.460,or a satellite or a recurrent melanoma
8N0IZZpF8ts,4025,01:14:04.460,01:14:06.220,or a satellite or a recurrent melanoma you don't measure the depth of it okay
8N0IZZpF8ts,4026,01:14:06.220,01:14:06.230,you don't measure the depth of it okay
8N0IZZpF8ts,4027,01:14:06.230,01:14:07.660,you don't measure the depth of it okay the depth is only measured on the
8N0IZZpF8ts,4028,01:14:07.660,01:14:07.670,the depth is only measured on the
8N0IZZpF8ts,4029,01:14:07.670,01:14:10.180,the depth is only measured on the primary melanoma so it doesn't matter
8N0IZZpF8ts,4030,01:14:10.180,01:14:10.190,primary melanoma so it doesn't matter
8N0IZZpF8ts,4031,01:14:10.190,01:14:11.770,primary melanoma so it doesn't matter how deep that is that's not the
8N0IZZpF8ts,4032,01:14:11.770,01:14:11.780,how deep that is that's not the
8N0IZZpF8ts,4033,01:14:11.780,01:14:14.350,how deep that is that's not the prognostic impact is if it's actually a
8N0IZZpF8ts,4034,01:14:14.350,01:14:14.360,prognostic impact is if it's actually a
8N0IZZpF8ts,4035,01:14:14.360,01:14:16.090,prognostic impact is if it's actually a satellite lesion or a metastasis that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,4036,01:14:16.090,01:14:16.100,satellite lesion or a metastasis that's
8N0IZZpF8ts,4037,01:14:16.100,01:14:18.459,satellite lesion or a metastasis that's what matters then the primary tumor
8N0IZZpF8ts,4038,01:14:18.459,01:14:18.469,what matters then the primary tumor
8N0IZZpF8ts,4039,01:14:18.469,01:14:20.170,what matters then the primary tumor depth doesn't really matter anymore once
8N0IZZpF8ts,4040,01:14:20.170,01:14:20.180,depth doesn't really matter anymore once
8N0IZZpF8ts,4041,01:14:20.180,01:14:21.550,depth doesn't really matter anymore once the melanoma started the spread or it
8N0IZZpF8ts,4042,01:14:21.550,01:14:21.560,the melanoma started the spread or it
8N0IZZpF8ts,4043,01:14:21.560,01:14:23.770,the melanoma started the spread or it doesn't matter much at least now the
8N0IZZpF8ts,4044,01:14:23.770,01:14:23.780,doesn't matter much at least now the
8N0IZZpF8ts,4045,01:14:23.780,01:14:25.600,doesn't matter much at least now the last thing I'll show is when you see
8N0IZZpF8ts,4046,01:14:25.600,01:14:25.610,last thing I'll show is when you see
8N0IZZpF8ts,4047,01:14:25.610,01:14:27.459,last thing I'll show is when you see this this is what I often see when I see
8N0IZZpF8ts,4048,01:14:27.459,01:14:27.469,this this is what I often see when I see
8N0IZZpF8ts,4049,01:14:27.469,01:14:29.350,this this is what I often see when I see a distant metastasis of melanoma I
8N0IZZpF8ts,4050,01:14:29.350,01:14:29.360,a distant metastasis of melanoma I

8N0IZZpF8ts,4065,01:14:41.980,01:14:44.310,subacute is that's the pattern I usually see when I see metastatic melanoma in

8N0IZZpF8ts,4095,01:15:14.860,01:15:16.380,aspect all of those are features histologically that should make you
8N0IZZpF8ts,4096,01:15:16.380,01:15:16.390,histologically that should make you
8N0IZZpF8ts,4097,01:15:16.390,01:15:18.750,histologically that should make you consider the possibility of melanoma and
8N0IZZpF8ts,4098,01:15:18.750,01:15:18.760,consider the possibility of melanoma and
8N0IZZpF8ts,4099,01:15:18.760,01:15:20.190,consider the possibility of melanoma and that should give you a good starting
8N0IZZpF8ts,4100,01:15:20.190,01:15:20.200,that should give you a good starting
8N0IZZpF8ts,4101,01:15:20.200,01:15:21.990,that should give you a good starting point and from there there's a lifetime
8N0IZZpF8ts,4102,01:15:21.990,01:15:22.000,point and from there there's a lifetime
8N0IZZpF8ts,4103,01:15:22.000,01:15:23.670,point and from there there's a lifetime worth of learning to learn all the

8N0IZZpF8ts,4105,01:15:23.680,01:15:25.320,worth of learning to learn all the features like I said I'm still learning
8N0IZZpF8ts,4106,01:15:25.320,01:15:25.330,features like I said I'm still learning
8N0IZZpF8ts,4107,01:15:25.330,01:15:26.730,features like I said I'm still learning new stuff every day about mole
8N0IZZpF8ts,4108,01:15:26.730,01:15:26.740,new stuff every day about mole
8N0IZZpF8ts,4109,01:15:26.740,01:15:28.410,new stuff every day about mole anesthetic lesions so I hope this at

8N0IZZpF8ts,4111,01:15:28.420,01:15:29.580,anesthetic lesions so I hope this at least gives you a good framework to
8N0IZZpF8ts,4112,01:15:29.580,01:15:29.590,least gives you a good framework to
8N0IZZpF8ts,4113,01:15:29.590,01:15:32.070,least gives you a good framework to start with and I'll plan to make some
